His Majesty Gets Jealous)

(Imperial Study)

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.744
Chief Wu.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.240
You're quite something.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.000
You left the Servitude Bureau so fast

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:30.360
and even came

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.320
to serve His Majesty.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.640
You flatter me, Chief Wu.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.960
I was

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.160
just lucky.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.624
Chief Wu.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.960
His Majesty

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.240
is hosting a banquet
for General Wansong in a few days.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.920
Can we talk about it?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.720
The Ministry of Rites

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.240
will handle this.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.040
Don't overreach.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.080
I dare not.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.840
His Majesty has long been wary

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.320
of the Zhao family.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
How would His Majesty feel

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.760
if someone could

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040
discipline General Zhao?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.680
How dare you speculate about

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.640
His Majesty's intentions?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.600
Stop while you can.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.040
His Majesty doubts me.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.320
Consort Wan sees me
as a thorn in her side.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.840
If I don't take risks,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.840
I'll end up being dead.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.000
You're my only hope now.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.840
It turns out

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.920
to be my delusions.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.120
What delusions?

00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:32.680
(Chengxi Palace)

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.600
Oh my.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.720
Greetings, Consort Wan

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.736
and Concubine Zhao.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.920
Brother, please rise.

00:01:38.688 --> 00:01:39.680
(Zhao Wansong)

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.840
No need for formalities.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.640
You should have announced your arrival

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
so that we could
welcome you at the gates.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.360
You've returned safely.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.640
We can finally be at ease.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.040
Congratulations on your triumph.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.880
Congratulations
have been pouring in relentlessly.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.160
I'm tired of

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.640
those celebratory words.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.160
Spare me the formalities here.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.560
His Majesty is hosting

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.480
a banquet to celebrate your victory.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.120
With your support,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.680
we can stand firmer
in the imperial harem.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.600
Thanks to your protection,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.840
we're able to move forward

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.896
fearlessly.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.560
Our fates are intertwined.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.320
We are deeply grateful to you.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.640
Throughout the court,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.080
no one rivals my achievements.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.840
Set your minds at ease.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.280
The Zhao family

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.760
will grow greater each day.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.920
Let's not stand here.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.440
Shall we go inside

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.528
and talk?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.720
Leave those there.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.448
Put this here.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.288
Alright.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.680
You may leave.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.264
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.360
Isn't it the maid
who delivered dance shoes?

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.880
You're serving

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.640
His Majesty now?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.360
My respects to Consort Wan,
Concubine Zhao,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.800
and General.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.880
Rise.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.680
Concubine Zhao.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.880
Please sit somewhere else.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.480
I am the imperial consort.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840
You're not

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.960
in the position to tell me where to sit.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.520
Your Highness.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.248
Today's banquet honors

00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:22.899
the warriors who have won the battle.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.440
Please don't

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.480
steal the thunder from the General.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.640
In that case,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.040
I shall sit beside His Majesty.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.040
His Majesty has arrived.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.840
May Your Majesty be ever blessed
and in peace.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
Rise.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920
Useless servants.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.040
Why didn't you announce

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040
His Majesty's arrival?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.080
I told them not to.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.080
It's your family reunion.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.400
I hate to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.640
interrupt you.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.968
Be seated.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:01.344
(Qinglu Hall)

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.480
General, enjoy.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.760
(This fool is so tacky.)

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.160
Please allow me to borrow

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.880
Your Majesty's wine

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.840
to thank you for hosting this feast,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.440
which grants me the chance

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.760
to meet Their Highnesses.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.952
We're family.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.960
General Zhao, feel free to visit

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.200
more often.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.480
The wine from Qinglu Hall
truly lives up to its reputation.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.680
Its aroma lingers,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.040
awakening the palate,
and leaving an aftertaste.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.304
General Zhao,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.440
drink freely tonight.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.280
We have plenty of fine wine.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.240
Qinglu Hall's wine is excellent,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.960
but don't overdrink, brother.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.008
Well.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.448
Your Majesty,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.640
it's been so long
since I last saw my brother.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.960
Meeting him now,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.240
I notice silver strands in his hair

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.680
and frayed cuffs.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.440
It pains my heart.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.440
Despite all his military merits,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.680
my brother doesn't
have anyone to care for him.

00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:12.840
Please

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.880
allow me

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.280
to request a favor.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.280
Please allow me to select

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.560
a suitable companion

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.600
for my brother.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.680
General Zhao suppressed

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.320
the southwest rebellion

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.600
for the court.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.040
Do as you wish.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.008
Your Highness.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.240
This glazed gold hairpin
was your favorite accessory.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.320
His Majesty dislikes extravagance,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.880
so you never wear it.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.800
Why did you take it out today?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.080
His Majesty's love is unpredictable.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.600
How can you blame it on a hairpin?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.448
Your Highness.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.920
How dare you

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.440
neglect Consort Jing?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.320
Why is there only milk

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.560
but no bird's nest

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.840
in the dessert today?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.160
I apologize.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.240
Please spare me.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.720
The Imperial Kitchen staff

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.160
said the bird's nests

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.840
were used for the banquet tonight.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.480
Those fawning wretches.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.512
Lv He.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.240
It's just some bird's nest.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520
Let her go.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.520
Thank you.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.336
Your Highness.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.720
Consort Wan

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.320
and Concubine Zhao
flaunt their family's influence.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.920
His Majesty usually

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.000
dines with you on the full moon day.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.760
But he didn't come today.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.760
Even the servants are neglecting you.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.880
It doesn't matter.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.840
The moon waxes and wanes.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.960
Every flow has its ebb.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.080
The Zhao family's arrogance

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.240
has offended His Majesty.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.520
Their days are about to end.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.472
General Zhao.

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:14.960
Ling Yun.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.600
Your clumsiness is unbecoming.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.920
It's fine.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.520
I was careless.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.808
(Ling Yun.)

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.680
(After all, you're just a maid.)

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.720
(No matter how smart you are,)

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.240
(you only seek
to climb the social ladder.)

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.920
Brother,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.840
you're showing
unusual favor to this maid.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040
Could it be...

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.464
Your Highness,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.776
I do

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.080
find this maid

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440
remarkably clever.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.240
I need to have

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.320
someone attentive who understands

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.640
my needs.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.840
I boldly request

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.720
to seek grace from Your Majesty
and Your Highnesses.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.200
Will you

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.200
grant this maid to me?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.960
I will appreciate it.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.800
Thank you, General.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.240
I'm flattered.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.416
(You wretch.)

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.480
(If my brother manages to get you out,)

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.280
(I'll torment you to death.)

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.920
You are an esteemed general.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.160
Ling Yun is just a maid.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.520
You're out of her league.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.240
Consort Wan should

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.560
select a noblewoman
worthy of your status.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.760
Your Majesty speaks wisely.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.160
A lowly maid

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.880
doesn't deserve my brother.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.560
I didn't think it through.

00:08:38.144 --> 00:08:40.320
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520
Your Majesty,

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.640
you are truly thoughtful.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.320
Zhao Yanwan, have you lost your mind?

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.040
How dare you set up my brother?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.800
Don't worry, sister.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.720
Our brother defended our nation.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.840
His Majesty wouldn't

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.840
take his drunken ramblings seriously.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.640
But that wretched maid harbors ambitions

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.360
to attach herself to our brother.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.040
Just wait and see.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.800
Stop playing clever.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.440
My brother risked his life

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.440
to earn his military merits.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.960
If he gets implicated,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.320
I won't let you off.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.400
How dare you!

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.440
You'd better behave at my Chengxi Palace.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.640
What a joke.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.280
You really think highly of yourself.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.960
I'm the true heiress of the Zhao family.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.320
You're just an entertainer
trained by my family.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.240
Without the Zhao family,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.120
you'd still be singing
for someone out there.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.040
Mention entertainer
in my presence again,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.240
and I'll tear you apart.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.816
Your Majesty.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.640
Please calm down.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.080
Who said she would share my burden

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.600
and discipline

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.040
the arrogant at the feast?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.360
I did.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.840
Without me,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.120
you would have

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.000
fallen prey to Zhao Wansong.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.240
Discipline?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.640
You need to be disciplined.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.864
Your Majesty,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.360
I'm just a lowly palace maid

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.640
who seduced General Zhao a little.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.360
Why is Your Majesty getting jealous?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.120
Ling Yun.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.224
Stop this nonsense.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.720
Know your place.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.560
How dare you seduce my minister?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.928
So I should have

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.240
let him have you?

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.920
Your Majesty,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.880
I merely wished to test your general.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.120
Had General Zhao ignored me,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.200
Your Majesty could rest assured.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.880
Unfortunately,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.280
he succumbed to my charms.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.080
Your charms?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.040
You are so shameless.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.760
Your Majesty.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.960
You can guess

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.080
whether General Zhao
has forgotten about me.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.248
He has no choice.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.000
Everyone in the nation

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.800
serves the sovereign.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.920
As a minister,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.720
how dare he covet my maid?

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.440
You hold the Mandate of Heaven

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.800
and don't see
all the filth in the world.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.360
I believe

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.560
that General Zhao

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.440
has set his sights on me.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.960
I promised

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.960
to give him a warning.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.120
And I'll keep that promise.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.040
Be patient, Your Majesty.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.320
Just wait and see.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.560
I'd like to crack open your skull

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.960
to see what schemes brew inside.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.720
I have no schemes,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.600
only unwavering loyalty to Your Majesty.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.920
Eunuch Tong An says
Your Majesty toils on state affairs,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.880
often losing sleep.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.240
So I've been trying to help

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.480
Your Majesty sleep well.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.440
What have you been eating

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.640
to make you become a sweet-talker?

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.840
Thank you for the reward.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.240
What reward?

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.960
Didn't Your Majesty reward me with food?

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.240
You asked what I'd eaten.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.920
I haven't eaten yet.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.240
I'm starving.

00:12:29.056 --> 00:12:30.600
This is His Majesty's reward.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.280
Won't you have some, Chief Wu?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.280
You've made so many enemies.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.040
Aren't you afraid of getting poisoned?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.000
His Majesty rewarded me
for the first time.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.560
I can't throw these away

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.800
even if they're poisoned.

00:12:51.744 --> 00:12:53.120
(Qinglu Hall)
Rest assured.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.040
I've tested the wine and dishes.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.992
There's no poison.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.240
Chief Wu.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.400
Actually,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.480
I approached Zhao Wansong
while he was drunk

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.800
and flirted with him

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.560
to mislead Consort Wan

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.440
that I was interested in him.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.640
Why are you telling me this?

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.360
Are you trying to tell me

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.560
you're both cunning and tactical,

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.680
or that you're recklessly bold

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680
and fearless of death?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.960
I'm neither cunning nor tactical.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.520
But I am somewhat reckless.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.080
One day,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.240
I'll make Consort Wan kneel at my feet

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.440
and beg for mercy.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.600
Will you help me?

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.424
(Ling Yun.)

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.800
(You're risking)

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.080
(your life.)

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.640
(I honestly don't know
if I should be helping you.)
