I'm not all that naive or anything.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.360
Thank you, Ya.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.080
Have a good night.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.840
Hey...

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.640
Huh?

00:00:58.353 --> 00:00:59.675
So realistic

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.233
that we have to share
a real goodbye kiss?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.200
Alright, fine.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.680
Muah, muah, muah...

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.280
You're delusional.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.440
I was just gonna tell you
something important about my family.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.840
All the men in my family

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.280
can read minds.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.200
Huh?!

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.280
Wait, so that means...

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.680
I can't look anyone in the eye!

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.440
Ugh, please!

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.560
Do you realize how hard it is
to avoid everyone's eyes?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.120
I can't even avoid
your gaze these days,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.520
so how could I even avoid eye contact
of all the men in your family?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.440
As long as you wear this necklace,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.920
no one can read your mind,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.680
except when they touch you on your skin.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320
Like this.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.960
I won't be able to read your mind.

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:45.815
What...

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.960
- What are you doing?!
- "What are you doing?!"

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.680
I'm making sure you know

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.760
that if I touch your skin like this,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.160
I will be able to read your mind.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And why is my heart racing this badly?

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.360
Is it the necklace?

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.800
Thank you, Ya.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.560
Have a good night.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.880
Hey...

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.460
Apo!

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.640
Long time no see.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.520
How are you doing?

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:09.473
If you see one
that's unusually friendly,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.770
that would be Chanjak,
my younger brother.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.520
He's cunning,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.160
and always ready to tease Apo.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.680
Most of the time,
Apo will be the one getting fed up

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.020
and staying away from him.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.960
Hello!

00:06:25.126 --> 00:06:26.046
Hello...

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.420
Apo...

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.400
you...seem different today.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.080
Uh...

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.960
Different how?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.950
He was simply saying hi.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.800
I don't know.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.620
I just know he seems different today.

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:50.966
You're imagining things, Chan.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.360
Wait,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.720
is it the new hairstyle

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.200
that makes you cuter?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.880
Hey...

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.800
- Argh!
- Whoa!

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.908
Argh!

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.140
As for Daonuer,
the youngest brother of my family,

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.226
you can be at ease

00:07:08.671 --> 00:07:10.071
because his ability hasn't awakened.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.760
Um, are you alright?

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.000
Give me my penguin plushie, or else...

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.600
You didn't have it with you?!

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.802
Bang!

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.200
That's so skibidi!

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.150
- There, come here.
- "Skibidi"?

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600
It's alright.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.970
I'll bring it to you next time.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.560
Milady,

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.920
Mr. Apo has arrived.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.620
But he seems polite today,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.640
looking like a kind young master.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.920
Plus, he seems to be really close
with His Excellency!

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.680
Huh.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.200
No amount of pretending
is going to cover it all!

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.360
I will be the one busting him!

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.640
Little Ari,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.080
have you got everything prepared?

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440
Yes, Madam.

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:30.353
Today's final boss
is going to be my mother,

00:08:30.872 --> 00:08:32.960
'Lady Pripprao.'

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.080
Huh?!

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.460
She's even more capable
than mind reading?!

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.960
No,

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:39.665
she never knows about this ability.

00:08:40.643 --> 00:08:42.443
You don't have
to be concerned about that;

00:08:42.468 --> 00:08:44.188
you just have to win her heart.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.360
Hasn't the water been served yet?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.280
The guests must be absolutely furious.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.870
Excuse me.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.600
Oops!

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.200
- Oh, my goodness!!
- Oh!

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.760
You're all soaked!

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.320
Goodness, what should we do?!

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.960
Are you gonna fire her
like you did the last maid?!

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.400
Alas!

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.480
My deepest apologies. I didn't mean to!

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.120
I really am sorry!

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.240
It's completely fine.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.760
I'll...

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.320
I'll just pat it dry.

00:09:32.273 --> 00:09:33.080
Huh?

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.680
Sorry...

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.600
Alright.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720
Please.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.200
It's Thai food
with such a savory taste.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.440
First, it's the sourness,

00:10:13.788 --> 00:10:14.880
accompanied by the spiciness,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.000
sweetness,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.120
and saltiness.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.684
The taste is familiar, but...

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.720
I can't quite put my finger on it.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.120
Sour curry.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.800
That's right.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.040
That's Ari's special sour curry,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.200
served as a deconstructed dish.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.520
The soup has been transformed
into a granita,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.320
while the fried egg with climbing wattle
has been turned into gels.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.280
As for the shrimps,
I blended them into mousses

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.120
before using
molecular gastronomy techniques

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.760
- and...
- I think that's quite enough, Ari.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.120
Everybody now knows
how good a chef you are!

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.001
Oh, but earlier,

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.640
Ya himself was quite impressive

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.395
for recognizing
his ex-girlfriend's cooking!

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.200
An ex back in kindergarten, too.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.320
Here,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.240
what happened was

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.720
I paid a visit
to Little Ari's house the other day,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.760
and she made me this dish.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.800
I honestly couldn't get enough of it,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.554
so I wanted everyone to have a taste!

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.800
Look, you can say otherwise,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.060
but anyone
who becomes Little Ari's partner

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.960
is truly enviable!

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.720
Who in the world

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.560
could be this beautiful
and this good at cooking?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.400
Anyone who gets to make her
their daughter-in-law

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.640
is blessed for life!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.680
Am I right, Ya?

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.680
Yes,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.358
anyone would be blessed
if they have a partner who can cook,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.400
but I'm fine either way

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.280
because we have maids.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.160
Uh, but I still think

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.440
it's better to have basic skills.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.260
Even just half of what Ari can do

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.440
would put me at ease.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.920
Isn't that right, Apo?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.077
Right?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.960
You old impudent hag!

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.880
What nonsense are you babbling?!

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.320
Apo!

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.600
How could you say that to my mother?!

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.520
Do you have to be so despicable?!

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.913
Your mother

00:12:48.953 --> 00:12:50.480
is deliberately provoking me!!

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.153
Hey!

00:12:52.193 --> 00:12:54.953
If you like
the housewife type that much,

00:12:54.993 --> 00:12:58.720
why didn't you just go and marry
your little perfect housewife Ari?!

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.473
Apo!!

00:13:01.513 --> 00:13:04.080
I'm at my limit!!

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.360
You have no right
to talk to her that way!

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.040
You and I are done!!

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.160
- Dump his ass!
- Ya!

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.280
That's offensive!!

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.640
Get out!!

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.720
As for my mother,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.840
you can try
behaving normally around her.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.200
Maybe she'll like you the way you are.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.960
Then,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.520
would you allow me
to make you a meal today?

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.800
Come on,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.600
I'll put on your apron for you,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.320
baby.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.120
All done.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.280
Thank you.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.880
What are they cooking, bro?

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.960
I don't have a clue,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.360
but...

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.960
it smells divine.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.520
I heard that Apo is the cook,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.880
so I rushed home
right after my business is done.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.873
As for my father, M.C. Jakkawarn,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.760
he is not hard to win over.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.600
Then, I'll serve it to you
right away, Your Serene Highness.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.680
Please do!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.560
It looks really plain.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.040
I'd say the taste
is also no match to Ari's.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.466
It's better than Ari's!

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.080
It tastes good...

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.560
but a little too spicy!

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.040
Though, I'd say this is rich.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.280
But people who dislike spicy food

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.520
could never handle this!

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.840
Well, it's...

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.560
Overall, she's saying it's delectable.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.680
Let's see.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.480
Let me try.

00:16:12.866 --> 00:16:15.099
Even though it's easy to win his heart,

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:16.453
the hard part...

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:18.166
Thank you...

00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:20.716
is that he is the king of mind readers!

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.520
Even if there's something in the way,

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.034
- he can still read your mind!
- so much!

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.840
Enjoy your meal, sir!

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.280
What a dork.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.600
I like it!

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.190
Yas!

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.160
Survived the meal without a scratch!

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.130
No one was able to touch me!

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.320
Game over.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.680
Has Apo really changed?

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.840
The same goes for Ya,

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.280
why is he into that kid
all of a sudden?!

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.600
There's something
suspicious between these two...

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.640
Or is it that...

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.360
Apo tricked my son into marrying him

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.720
using his family's business?!

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.800
Ugh!

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.600
I won't let my son
marry the person he's not into.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.840
Code red.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.800
Honestly,

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.120
you didn't have to cook
to appease anyone.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.600
Mother was just trying to provoke you.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.280
You could've just listened
until she was done.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.840
You told me yourself

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.120
that Apo was madly in love with you,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.380
so how could I just sit there

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.040
listening to her praising someone else

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.920
for being a better fit for you?

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.440
Uh...

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.960
I meant,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.920
I was thinking on behalf of Apo.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.880
I don't mind
if those were your own feelings.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Just kidding.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520
It was a joke.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.360
Try making that joke again,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.280
and I'll take it seriously.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.040
Just kidding.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.520
In all honesty,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.360
I never knew
you were this good at cooking.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.640
Gosh,

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.920
cooking, serving, providing services,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.080
you name it, I do it all.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.400
You won't believe
how many part-time jobs I took

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.680
when I was in the other world.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.920
If there are 24 hours in a day,

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.960
I probably work 48!

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.800
I never have time
to enjoy life like other people.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.540
But I really enjoyed it today.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640
What about you?

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.380
Do you enjoy being with me?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.760
M.R. Ya!

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.000
- My baby Ya!
- Yes, baby?

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.240
Do you want more sour curry today?

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.480
You mean your delicious sour curry?

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.560
Oh!

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.890
My bad

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.080
for interrupting your romantic time.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.080
What's up?

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.800
Father and Mother
need to have a word with you.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.800
Wanna come?

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.560
Alright.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.160
Huh?

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.480
You want me to move in with Ya
before the engagement ceremony, Mother?

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.000
Um...

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.880
Is that a good idea?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.840
The Lady herself
was the one proposing this.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.000
A youngster like you
wouldn't mind, right, Apo?

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.960
Consider it a trial run
for your relationship.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.320
In case you guys don't make it,

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.900
we won't need
a press conference about your divorce

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.880
to humiliate ourselves
in front of everyone.

00:21:08.104 --> 00:21:09.104
Uh...

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.480
But...

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.520
is this gonna be
too much trouble for Ya?

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.040
Plus, I don't think

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.880
Papa and Mama
would approve of this idea.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.360
I'm feeling my heart sink

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.840
as you won't be living
in this house anymore.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.960
That's you feeling your heart sink?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.360
Don't interrupt people

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.000
when they are having their moment.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.280
But no matter how bad it feels,

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.680
I'm worry-free.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.800
All this time, I forced you
into marrying His Excellency

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.960
because I want someone decent

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.000
to take care of you in my place.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.440
Everything His Excellency has been doing

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.800
assures your father and me

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.540
that we have got the right one.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.800
No matter what,
take good care of yourself.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.200
Of course.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.980
Papa, Mama, just send him off.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.800
The car's been running for so long
it's running out of gas.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.280
Alright, give me a hug.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.400
Take care, my dear.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.720
Are you forgetting someone, Apo?

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.360
I don't think so.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.680
Think about it again.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.040
- Without him, you can't fall asleep!
- Mm!

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.480
It's your most beloved pet,

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.080
Jessica, my dear!

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.850
- Oh, Jessica!
- That's right, Jessica!

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.520
- Do I have to take him?
- Jessica is here!

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.200
Oh...

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.160
I...

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.600
- I completely forgot about him!
- Yeah!

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.800
How could you even?

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.280
He's your sleep buddy!

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.160
Wow...

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.600
- Alright, hurry along.
- Come on.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.600
You, can you help...

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.240
Do I really get to live here
with M.R. Suriya?

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.900
We will eat together,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.840
watch TV together,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.520
and sleep on the same bed!

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.640
We're sleeping separately.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.160
- Hey!
- So don't worry.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.760
Wait,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.240
did you touch me?

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.840
How did you know my thoughts?

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760
Look,

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.120
just looking at you,

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.220
I can see

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.200
all those delusional thoughts.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.160
And tonight,

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.120
don't sneak into my room.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.840
Right,

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.130
you take the small bedroom.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.740
Wait, you...

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.040
Hey! Why did you come in here?!

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.320
We'll have to move
into the same room now.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.640
Mother sent Butler Francois
to keep an eye on us.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.920
Who's Butler Francois?

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.080
I will send you to Siao Dara

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.440
to expose a phony couple.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.360
Catch them red-handed!

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.240
There's no time.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.320
Just my luck!

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.080
From now on,
we'll have to act as full-time lovers,

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.170
Apo.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.280
No one has answered
the door yet, Milady.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.200
They are probably staging the scene.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.880
Hey,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.800
and who is this Butler Francois?!

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.540
Why are you so terrified of him?

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.920
Francois is a butler
for special missions,

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.600
and he doesn't work at Siao Dara.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.700
Frankly,

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.440
he's more like Mother's right-hand man.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.080
Rumor has it

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.440
that he was a former spy,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.160
so my mom often sends him to investigate.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.240
Yes!

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.600
- Hey!
- Freeze!

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.080
You sure are taking your time.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.240
The bad guys already ran off.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.640
Luckily,

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.880
the important documents
are still with me.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480
And who are you?

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.840
- Whoa!
- Hey!

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.160
I'm Frank,

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.120
an FBI agent assigned
to investigate this case.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.960
But first,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.000
can you lower your guns?

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.160
Hurry and chase after the bad guys.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.320
I've called in reinforcements
to look for clues here.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:27:59.960
Come along!

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.920
Isn't it like
something out of a fantasy?

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.760
I guess she probably doesn't buy
that we love each other,

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.480
so she sent Francois to look into it.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.080
Argh!!

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.000
I thought I beat the final boss!

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.640
For that reason,
when Francois is around,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.880
we need to act like we're madly in love.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.100
Got it?

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920
We're running out of time.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.160
- Follow me!
- What?

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:04.720
Whoa!

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.320
My apologies for interrupting.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.040
Uh, it's...

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.200
- It's not...
- No need to be shy, baby.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.840
It's what lovers do.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.080
Well then, allow me to introduce myself.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.320
I, Butler Francois,

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.600
am here to serve
M.R. Suriya and Young Master Apo

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.320
during your stay at this penthouse.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.320
Hey...

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.760
Your silly Excellency, asleep?

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.880
I am about to.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.320
Why?

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.520
You can't fall asleep?

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.620
Mm...

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.370
maybe this place feels unfamiliar,

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.760
and someone beside me is also unusual.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.640
Who'd sleep in this situation?

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.120
Huh.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.640
Just say your heart's
too shaken to sleep.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.000
Ugh,

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.440
the audacity!

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.280
My heart's shaken for you?

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.040
Then, take off that necklace
and look me in the eye.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160
Just kidding.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.480
But I see you're really blushing.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.560
Blushing when?

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.880
I'm not blushing.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.120
Alright, alright.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.600
I'll sleep on the floor,

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.320
so you can quit being so tense.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.800
Uh, Your Excellency...

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.120
It's fine.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.200
I'll take the floor.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.560
I'm used to it.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.720
Whatever floats your boat.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.920
But if you sleep worse
than you did before,

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.050
don't say I didn't warn you.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.640
How did I get up here?

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.250
Is it...

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.150
Wow...

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.880
He's a total Sleeping Beauty.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.520
Then, awaken me with a kiss.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.560
Whoa!

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.000
You said I was
a Sleeping Beauty, didn't you?

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.280
And why did you wake up
just to stare at me?

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.400
What are you talking about?!

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.840
I wasn't staring at you!

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.560
Are you... Are you narcissistic,

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.400
- crazy, or...
- Hush.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.720
Baby,

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.480
don't forget

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.380
that we have to be loving,

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.040
not fighting.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.440
I wasn't staring at you! Are you...

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.720
Are you narcissistic,

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.280
- crazy, or...
- Hush.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.260
I heard some noises,
measured at approximately 70 decibels

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.580
and possibly from fighting, Milady.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.440
Morning, baby.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.400
Uh, morning, boo boo.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.440
Last night,
did I cuddle you too tightly?

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.680
If I did, you can tell me, baby.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.840
I could barely breathe, actually.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.640
Then, I'll go easy on you tonight.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.280
Aww.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.500
Is my baby blushing?

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.360
What would you like for breakfast,
Your Excellency and Young Master?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.800
- Uh, I'll have a fried egg...
- It's all good.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.080
I'll cook for my fiancé today.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.000
Please.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.040
Milady,

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.120
they seem like a couple
on the first day of moving in together.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.200
But please be at ease.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.800
No matter how many footsteps,

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.120
seconds,

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.520
and breaths they take,

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.360
nothing escapes my sight!

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.120
That's not my voice lagging.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.800
That was an affirming laugh, Milady.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.600
Thank you.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.360
Here you go.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.520
Thank you.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.650
- Ya,
- Hm?

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.200
can you open this for me?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.880
Of course.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.480
Would you like me to try?

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.360
Here.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.840
Thank you.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.680
Thailand's hotels are second to none!

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.440
Siao Tawan Hotel has remained number 1
in 'The Best Hotels in Asia' ranking

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.960
for 10 consecutive years.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.920
The current executives, M.C. Jakkawarn

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.080
and his son M.R. Suriya,

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.240
both say to us determinedly that

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.440
they are aiming for 'The Best Hotels
in the World' within 5 years!

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:48.780
Aww,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.880
you're the best out there, Ya!

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.500
Good job!

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.400
Of course,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.880
thanks to my amazing boyfriend
for the encouragement!

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.680
Ow, that hurts!

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.600
You're the cutest.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.240
Here you go.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.040
Let me feed you.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.880
It's good, isn't it?

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.360
Gosh!

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.320
When is he gonna leave?!

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.120
I can't feel my butt anymore!

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.440
You wanna see us kissing or something?!

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.400
Mr. Butler,

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.160
I want to spend
some alone time with my fiancé.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.760
You can be dismissed.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.720
Yes, sir.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.600
Milady,

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.720
I'm not a shipper,

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.520
but these two...

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.760
are totally a thing!

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.920
What I witnessed was so romantic!

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.640
If they're not a couple,

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.360
then I don't know what is!

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.760
Your ship is going to sink very soon.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.200
I will call the backup myself.
