00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.480
(Shen's Diner)
Miss.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.910
How much is your candied hawthorn?

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.430
It's 5 qian per skewer.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.120
The braised chicken feet ones
are special,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.190
so they're more expensive.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.990
It's 8 qian each.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.070
Braised chicken feet
in candied hawthorns?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.880
Everything can be in candied hawthorns.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.760
What is that?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.680
I want that.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.470
It's a spicy candied hawthorn.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.470
Inside is spicy gluten.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.120
My niece loves it.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.240
Have a try?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.240
Try it.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.960
Is it delicious?

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.660
Sweet on the outside,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.700
spicy on the inside.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.650
It's delicious.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.200
Miss, I'll take this one.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.640
Thanks. Let's go home.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.400
Each jin of cheese candy costs 60 qian.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.200
Why sell your candied hawthorn

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.550
at five qian per skewer?

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.920
This is not made from cheese candy.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.370
We used sugar from Yangzhou.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.120
It's not cheap,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.580
but for making candied hawthorns,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.400
only a thin layer is needed

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.430
on the outside.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.360
Kids love sweets,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.680
so candied hawthorns

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.200
are the cheapest choice

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.120
for all the little friends in Yong'an.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360
Except for Yangyang.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.920
She's had enough sweets already.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.870
Little friends?

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.150
What an interesting phrase.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.430
It sounds like all the guests

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.430
in the diner are friends.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.710
Kids are "little friends",

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.360
and other guests are "big friends".

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.220
You and your family

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.700
always have these special words.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.180
Sometimes I feel

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.300
like you and I
are not from the same era,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.740
but

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.900
it's more interesting.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.900
It makes me want
to keep it this way forever

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.500
with you guys,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.300
especially you.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.460
I don't want any changes.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.180
Let me.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.940
(Candied Hawthorn)

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.500
Why are you alone in the diner?

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.620
To find a suitable mentor,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.820
my brother took Yangyang out.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.380
My parents were worried,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.620
so they went along as well.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.540
Deyuan caught a cold,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.220
so I told her to leave the diner

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.340
and see a physician.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.660
I'm off to cook.

you also have

Mother, it's snowing!

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.100

we can have a snowball fight.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.540
Jicai.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.820
Auntie.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.340
How was it?

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.860
- Any luck with the mentor?
- Mother.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.220
I want to make a snowman.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.340
No.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.980
None of them is as good as my dad.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.070
They can't even do maths properly.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.960
I still want to go to Hongwen Academy.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.840
You just don't want to go to school.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.820
You're aiming too high.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.820
Hongwen Academy?

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.100
Forget about it.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.220
If I can't go to Hongwen Academy,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.740
I don't want to go to school at all.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.100
Here comes the truth.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.580
You just don't want to study.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.500
Come on.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.540
Do something about this.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.820
Yangyang,

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.260
listen to me.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.450
There's one thing bad

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.420
about this place:

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.820
Girls are not allowed

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.980
in the school.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.420
Hongwen Academy is

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.180
where the Crown Prince studies.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.180
Our family doesn't have
any high officials.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.940
You can't even be admitted.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.740
We do have a high official
in our family.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.020
We have Mr. Lin, right?

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.300
It's not because of the Crown Prince

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.460
that I want to go there.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.300
Auntie asked around.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.800
They teach the six arts there,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.180
including horsemanship and archery.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.140
How wonderful!

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.660
Horsemanship and archery?

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.740
You just want to play.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.780
That's too dangerous.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.100
I just want to go to Hongwen Academy.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.340
- Hongwen Academy.
- Yangyang.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.100
Hongwen Academy.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.340
I want to go to Hongwen Academy.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.260
Alright.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.460
Let's think of a way to get you

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.860
into Hongwen Academy.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.820
Today is our first time

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.900
seeing snow in Yong'an.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.620
Why not have your dad make a snowman?

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.020
- Okay.
- Sure.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.300
I'll make you a snowman later.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.340
(Shen's Diner)

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.570
Whether it's an excuse

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.000
or really her wish,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.500
I think we do need

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.380
to think of a way.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.420
Girls are limited in this era,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.840
but I've thought about it.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.020
We still can't have Yangyang

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.500
study at home.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.960
Otherwise, she won't know

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.520
how to get along with her peers,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.980
and her horizons will narrow.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.660
Hongwen Academy is no ordinary place.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.460
It's frequented by nobility.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.260
Ordinary people simply can't get in.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.980
Besides,

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.220
girls aren't allowed in school.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.540
How are you going to solve that?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.820
You can't disguise her as a boy,
can you?

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.300
Disguising her as a boy...

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.620
It's possible.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.620
Come on.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.580
Disguising her as a boy...

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.620
Where...

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.020
It's getting cold.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.060
Would you like to warm up?

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.340
Try it.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.060
Well.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.340
I'm not sure about this flavor.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.340
Help me taste it.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.860
See if it's okay.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.500
Previously,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.940
I insisted on taking us to Sushui City,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.580
almost leading us

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.380
into danger.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.980
It was my fault.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.140
Since we came to Yong'an,

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.860
I've realized

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.860
that I was indeed

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.820
a bit arrogant.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.140
Actually,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.780
it's not just your problem.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.020
You do have your flaws,

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.380
but you never let us down
in crucial moments.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.580
Whether it was in Sushui City

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.220
or other times,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.340
whenever there was danger,

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.020
you stood up and protected us.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.620
I know I have a bad temper;

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.260
I can't keep making you endure it.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.940
I should change.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.020
It's my problem.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.820
How can I ask you to change?

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.460
It's me who needs to change.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.220
No, it's me who's at fault.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.740
I have a bad temper. I'll change.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.100
No, no.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.940
My problem

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.860
is definitely bigger than yours.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.420
I should change first.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.420
My temper is too bad.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.580
It's almost domestic violence.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.100
I always upset you. Give me it.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.420
No, you're my wife.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.540
Even if you have a problem,

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.180
it's my problem.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.020
It'll always be my problem.
I'll change first.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.460
Alright, alright.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.140
It's still your problem.
You change first.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.180
I...

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.140
I'll change.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.020
Silly.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.820
So, once I've changed,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.580
can I...

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.660
Well...

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.340
It's getting cold.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.540
You could catch a cold
sleeping in the diner.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.620
Move back in.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.660
Sure.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.100
My goodness.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.060
Oh, my.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.020
Mr. Lin is just so dexterous.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.740
The first one

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.020
made the dishwasher

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.500
would be born after over 1,000 years.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.540
He's an ancient man,

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.980
and he managed to create this.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.540
I seriously suspect that Mr. Lin

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.260
must've also traveled through time.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.260
It's not that.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.020
I used to complain about washing dishes,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.520
and I mentioned that there's a machine

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.680
called a dishwasher in our hometown.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.220
Then I just drew

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.860
a simple sketch.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.060
Who would've thought
he actually made it?

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.660
Mr. Lin is so good to you.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.820
It's so unfair.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.100
I also find sweeping very tiring,

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.860
but he didn't make me a robot cleaner.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.300
- So unique.
- Yes.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.240
I've never seen anything like it.
So beautiful.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.100
Here she is.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.340
Lady Shen.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.180
The snowman in front of your diner

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.380
is so unique.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.340
Today, I came here with two ladies

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.660
for a meal.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.020
I heard you were in the backyard,

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:44.860
so we came.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.020
What is this big box?

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.980
What's this?

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.460
Ladies, you may not know.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.140
This is called a dishwasher.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.340
Dishwasher?

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.820
It can wash dishes and bowls.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.940
In this cold winter,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.060
our hands won't have
to touch cold water.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.180
So amazing.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.580
Everything you eat and use

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.480
is so nice.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.620
You always have some unique

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.940
and interesting things.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.780
Exactly.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.220
Handsome Shen,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.100
it must be made by you, right?

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Of course.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.140
Mr. Shen,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.220
you're running a diner,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.380
and you're well-educated.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.340
Why not remarry?

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:18.860
I...

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.980
I want to focus on my career.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.100
I'm not in a hurry.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.100
Yangyang is still young.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.620
Mr. Shen is considering his daughter.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.580
But Lady Shen,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.020
are you worried about your marriage?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.860
Yes.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.300
You should think about yourself.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.500
I heard that you refused

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.820
the proposal of Mr. Liu
from Guixiang Tavern

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.660
a few days ago.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.140
The Liu family is one

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.060
of the wealthiest families.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.500
Even Mr. Liu is not good enough?

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.740
Lady Shen,

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.860
what kind of man do you like?

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.980
What kind of man do you like?

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.980
I'll introduce someone to you.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.820
Tell us.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.670
Right, Jicai.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.480
Even I don't know
what kind of man you like.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.940
She's shy.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.060
I like someone

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.380
who trusts me.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.580
Do you want us to win,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.460
or them to win?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.820
I bet on you winning.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.460
Someone who remembers what I said.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.780
That night, you drew it simply

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.820
and didn't explain much.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.140
I've thought it over and over,

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.100
but I still don't know

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.420
how to make it run by itself.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.180
So, I had to settle

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.980
for a hand-pulled rotating box.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.780
Someone who won't abandon me

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.540
to protect himself,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.860
no matter how hard it is.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.460
Hold my hand!

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.300
Mr. Lin, save me!

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.540
I swear on my life

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.980
that you will be fine.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.180
- Right.
- That's it?

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.300
Anything else?

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.580
Mr. Lin, you're off duty...

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.540
Your work is done?

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.820
Mr. Lin.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.020
Let's go.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.960
Let's go.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.140
I just saw many people

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.500
wanting to buy candied hawthorn,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.540
but no one was responding,

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.100
so I came here to check.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.140
No one?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.660
I'll go check.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.540
Thanks, Mr. Lin.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.860
Do I really like Lin Yan?

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.620
Jicai,

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.940
what did you just say?

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.420
Nothing.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.580
- Jicai!
- Auntie!

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.700
In this freezing weather,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.700
how could you jump into the pond?

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.140
Do you know that catching a cold

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.620
could easily be fatal in this era?

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.820
What were you thinking?

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.940
Here, come on.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.340
Hurry.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.460
Ginger milk.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.660
Come on, Jicai.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.700
Drink it.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.820
This girl...

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.460
Slow down.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.540
Sir,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.300
Second Master Zhao is still in Yong'an.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.220
He's Zhao Xunzhi from Hongwen Academy.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.940
It really is him.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.380
He changed his testimony,

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.900
slandering his close friend.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.060
How dare he teach here!

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.280
(The Case of Heluo Wang Kejiu)

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.430
From now on,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.940
try to get close to Zhao Xunzhi.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.500
Oh, Lady Shen fell into the pond

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.420
in the garden just now.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.140
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.700
I was talking about Zhao Xunzhi.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.180
Put your clothes on.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.540
Lady Shen?

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.540
Are you inside?

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.770
Go and stop him.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.620
Don't let him in.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.820
- Hurry.
- Go now.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.940
- Uncle.
- Mr. Lin.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.300
Why are you here?

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.140
It's so late.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.440
Shouldn't you be resting?

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.920
I heard Lady Shen fell into the water.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.940
I came to check on her.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.860
How is she?

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.740
She's fine.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.660
- It was an accident.
- Yes.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.860
Besides, your pond

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.940
isn't even up to her knees.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.160
Even if she wanted to get hurt,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.700
she couldn't.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.500
Why would she fall for no reason?

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.980
If it's okay,

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.300
may I go in and take a look?

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.500
It's not okay.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.260
Really not okay.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.520
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.380
I'll be quick.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.820
No, Mr. Lin.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.700
Control yourself.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.660
Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.740
- Mr. Lin.
- Calm down.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.180
Mr. Lin.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.420
Mr. Lin.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.380
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.420
How could you come in?

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.260
Sorry.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.420
I heard coughing

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.540
and got worried.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.420
Lady Shen, how are you?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.740
Thanks for your concern.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.300
It's just a cold, nothing serious.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.740
Please go back.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.260
Let me check on you

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.980
and make sure you're okay;
then I'll leave.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.020
I'm really fine.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.140
Don't come any closer.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.460
Please go back.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.860
How did it happen?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.980
Mr. Lin.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.740
Mr. Lin.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.980
Mr. Lin, you mustn't.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:33.940
Lady Shen...

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.060
Young Master.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.260
Young Master,

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.380
your cloak...

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.460
Shen Jianshe, your ancestor is in love.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.380
He came here without a cloak

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.060
because he was worried about Jicai.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.500
The ancients place great emphasis
on proper attire.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.940
So, he's doing this

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.140
because of Jicai.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.260
This is a big trouble.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.500
Why is it a big trouble?

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.940
Good girl,

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.940
it doesn't concern you.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.280
It's not suitable for kids.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.900
Put on the cloak.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.060
Liu Chang,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.740
go and bring all the charcoal stoves

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.300
and bedding.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.580
Yes.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.220
Mr. Lin,

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.340
you and Jicai
are both improperly dressed.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.340
Jicai is still

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.700
an unmarried lady.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.020
It's not appropriate for you

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.100
to rush in like this.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.340
Exactly.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:37.820
I'm sorry.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.340
We understand

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.580
you were worried about Jicai.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.220
You've seen her.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.540
She's really fine.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.340
She just caught a cold.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.020
Mr. Lin, please go back.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.540
Yes, Mr. Lin.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.140
You've seen that Jicai is fine.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.060
We'll take good care of her, right?

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.420
If there's nothing else,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.420
you might as well...

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:55.660
You should...

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.620
I'm really sorry.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.580
I've offended you.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.700
Please forgive me.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.660
If there's anything we can help with,

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.540
please let us know.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.580
Sure, we will.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.660
Why not just...

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.260
This is too awkward.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.700
Dad,

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.220
I just realized.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.540
Why are you here so late at night?

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.380
Well, your mom...

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.140
When did you start

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.820
meddling in my affairs?

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.220
In Yunshui Manor,

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.460
I come and go

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.420
as I please.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.580
Who dares to stop me?

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.060
I've told you so many times

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.540
that only your mom can stop me.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.540
Who else dares?

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.740
Besides,

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.180
does my business matter

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.060
at this moment?

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.980
It's getting late.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.620
Let Jicai rest.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.980
Let's talk outside.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.860
Let's go.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.660
No need to avoid me.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.460
I know what's going on.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.980
Alright, you guys talk here.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.540
I'll take Yangyang back to sleep.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.140
No.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.280
I'm not a child anymore.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.820
I want to join the discussion with you.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.660
Don't be silly.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.020
The topic is not suitable for you.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.500
- Go to sleep.
- I know.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.060
Auntie likes Lin Mr. Lin,

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.220
and Lin Mr. Lin likes Auntie.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.100
Don't talk nonsense.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.020
- Don't be so tough.
- Don't talk nonsense.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.900
It's okay that she said that.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.340
Mr. Lin's action just now has shown

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.220
how he feels about Jicai.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.860
Otherwise, he wouldn't have done that.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.700
According to history,

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.140
Mr. Lin's heart

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.820
should be with Ancestor Shen.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.260
Why has it shifted to Jicai now?

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.500
Isn't this a mess?

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.500
Jicai,

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.020
did you say something

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.340
or do something

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.020
that caused a misunderstanding?

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.420
Shen Jianshe,

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.100
how can you say that?

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.980
What's wrong?

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.620
- You can't blame her.
- What did I do?

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.980
This must be your ancestor

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.180
who is overthinking.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.940
I mean,

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.820
we can't blame Jicai for this.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.060
You all saw it just now.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.860
Jicai kept telling Mr. Lin to go back,

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.100
saying she was fine,

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.580
but he insisted on seeing her.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.980
This shows that Mr. Lin

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.260
is not being a proper man.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.260
Dear,

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.180
this has nothing to do with that.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.860
What am I afraid of?

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.620
I'm afraid of changing history.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.940
If history changes,

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.100
our whole family will vanish.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.940
Do you understand?

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.780
To solve the problem,

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.900
we must find out why.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.660
We have to find out

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.260
why Mr. Lin likes you.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.300
Once we figure it out, it'll be easy.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.780
Think again.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.620
Did you say

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.740
or do something that caused

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.900
a misunderstanding?

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.780
It's okay.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.540
We can just explain it to him, right?

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.660
Everything will get back on track.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.860
Isn't that what you mean?

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.220
So, it's Jicai's fault?

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.100
Jicai is so excellent.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.780
Does he need a reason to like her?

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.020
I just want to solve the problem.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.340
Why so argumentative?

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.380
Listen, Shen Jianshe.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.740
It's wrong to blame everything

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.900
- on Jicai.
- I didn't.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.780
Your ancestor

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:44.620
started this.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.820
Don't worry.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.060
Why blame her?

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.900
Mom.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.300
I grew up
under modern scientific education, okay?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.740
When I went
to Xingjiao Nunnery last time,

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.980
I realized my thoughts were not right.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.660
But I've purified my soul
in the prayer hall.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.740
I was just a bit emotional just now,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.780
but I'm fine now.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.460
Jicai,

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.580
you...

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.900
I'm really fine.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.340
As for the ancestor,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.900
he's just a normal man living
in ancient times.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.180
He hasn't met enough women,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.580
so he might just be curious
about me, a modern person.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.180
But Lady Jingwen showed up,

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.620
and she's so excellent.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.420
There's no way the ancestor
would stick with me.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.380
That makes sense.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.460
Indeed.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.170
Lady Jingwen does fit

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.220
the requirements of a lady in this era.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.660
She seems quite good.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.700
Right? I think so, too.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.740
Everything will get back on track soon.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.860
No.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.700
Tomorrow morning,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.780
we need to find a new house

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.820
to move out of Yunshui Manor asap.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.460
Physically,

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.260
we need to separate from Mr. Lin.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.020
This matter is urgent.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.240
It needs to be done at once.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.580
You do it.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:56.980
Me?

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.140
Your mom and I have to stay
in the diner.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.220
We don't have time.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.460
This is your opportunity.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.780
Can you seize it?

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.380
- Me.
- Gongcai.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.020
Try your best.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.340
Dad.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:12.900
Mom.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.540
This is the first time

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.380
in my life

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.420
you've given me

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.620
a family matter to handle.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.120
You've finally realized

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.380
that I am capable.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.340
Trust me.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.300
I'll surely find a house

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.860
that everyone will be satisfied with.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.700
I don't trust you.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.180
Why undermine your dad?

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.060
Me neither.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.700
Neither do I.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.540
Don't worry.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.380
I'll start making plans right now.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.420
Wait for my good news.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.740
(Address)
No. 5 in Chang'an Alley.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.700
The agent is Ms. Du.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.140
No. 5?

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.180
Excuse me,

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.180
are you Mr. Du?

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:21.980
Mei?

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.260
Wait a minute.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.380
Hurry up.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.860
Go, go, go.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.900
You're bad at this.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.580
Bye, I'm out.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.700
Alright.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.980
I've said this many times.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.700
I want my soy milk plain.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.820
Plain.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.500
Why do you always put sugar in it?

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.500
Sorry, dear.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.060
I'll pay attention next time.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.460
On the left.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.320
And these buns.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.700
We've been married for three years,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.740
and you can never remember

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.880
that I don't eat meat buns.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.300
Sorry, dear. I was wrong.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.740
I'll change next time.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.620
Shen Shaojie,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.500
I've been thinking for a long time,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.380
and I have to say it today.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.220
Let's get a divorce.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.260
Yangyang can stay with you.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.700
Sorry, dear. I was wrong.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.780
I'll change next time.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.060
Are you joking with me?

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.700
Dear, that's a pretty harsh move.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.580
Who taught you that?

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.820
You've scared me
out of playing this game.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.700
(Defeat)

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.220
Are you serious?

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.420
Are you angry?

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.980
The breakfast was wrong, right?

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.180
I remember.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.580
You want your soy milk sweet.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.740
No, salty.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.740
No, plain.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.940
And the buns you want...

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.540
I can just buy you another one.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.620
I'll buy you another one.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.700
No need.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:49.820
Shaojie,

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.420
to be honest,

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.620
I've fallen for someone else.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.380
Let's just end it here.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:58.940
Mei,

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.580
it really is you.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.260
When did you come?

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.460
How have you been here?

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.460
Why didn't you tell me?

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.500
Why didn't you come to me?

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.340
Go away.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.580
Sir,

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.300
we've never met before.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.140
If you keep this up,

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.500
I'll report you to the yamen.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.340
It's me.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.460
It's me!

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.780
Look closely.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.820
Don't you recognize me?

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.500
You...

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.700
Aren't you Mei?

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.980
You've mistaken me for someone else.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.980
My name is not Mei;

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.100
I don't know anyone by that name.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.540
How could that be?

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:35.660
Come on.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.340
Sir,

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.540
what are you trying to do?

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.180
You...

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.660
You...

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.100
Let's talk this through

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.260
calmly.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.060
It's impossible.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.140
You look exactly the same.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.220
Are you pretending

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.740
not to recognize me?

00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:58.980
Mei,

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.420
I've let you go,

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.500
and I'm completely different now.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.460
Trust me.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.860
- Wait.
- I just feel

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.260
that we can look out for each other

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.100
in this unfamiliar environment.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.380
I think letting go...

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.540
Shut up!

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.340
This is sheer slander.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.060
What a madman.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.020
It's really not her.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.460
Miss, Miss.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.300
Miss, Miss.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.300
Wait, wait.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.140
Well.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.660
Miss,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.780
I'm sorry.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.340
I just mistook you for someone else.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.020
I am Handsome Shen.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.820
Ms. Pang, Duke Lu's family,

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.020
told me you were a house agent.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.260
Handsome Shen?

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.220
No way.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.580
Ms. Shen told me

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.100
that Handsome Shen

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.500
is extremely handsome

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.540
and exceptionally wise.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.380
Well,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.940
I am indeed Handsome Shen.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.900
I know your surname is Du,

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.860
you're a house agent,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:49.780
and you're here leasing

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.500
the No. 5 house in Chang'an Alley.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.340
Right?

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.740
When I suddenly saw you just now,

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.900
you looked too much like an old friend.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.020
I hope you won't take offense.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.460
I was wrong about you, sir.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.700
Don't say that.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.300
My behavior was improper just now.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.860
How could I blame you?

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:09.750
By the way,

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.620
I heard you say just now

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.660
that your old friend is named Mei.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.020
She must be very important to you,

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.140
which is why you got so excited.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.340
Yes.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:21.900
Mei used

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.220
to be my wife.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.100
You look

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.460
quite similar to her.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.220
You haven't forgotten her.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.220
What an affectionate man.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.900
Not really.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.020
Emotionally,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.100
I have let her go.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.100
But back then,

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.580
I didn't give her

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.700
a good life.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.420
Every time I think of it,

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.780
I feel a bit guilty.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.560
You're moving out?

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.340
It's a bit sudden.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.860
But we've found a house.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.440
Sorry for all the trouble

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.140
during this time.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.540
Is it

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.860
because of Prince Zhao?

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.460
Let me be frank.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.380
Since we've decided to help you,

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.660
we're not afraid

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.220
that your relationship with Prince Zhao

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.620
will cause us any trouble,

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.380
and we won't change our minds.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.380
But

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.660
we do have to move out.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.620
If we stay any longer,

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.620
the neighbors will start gossiping.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.380
Besides,

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.580
if any rumors spread

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.980
about you and Shaoguang,

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.220
it wouldn't be good for anyone.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.180
What are

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.300
rumors?

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.540
Rumors are

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.380
scandalous news,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.500
saying improper things

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.660
about you two.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.500
I don't care.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.540
But we do.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.460
Mr. Lin,

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.900
to be honest,

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.380
you and Shaoguang

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.020
aren't a good match.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.020
We've made up our minds,

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.380
and we hope

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.020
you'll respect our decision.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.100
Milady, why are you here alone today?

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.020
Where are your parents?

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.860
Didn't they come?

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.180
They're moving.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.340
Moving?

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.820
Milady.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.820
Milady,

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.780
Mr. Lin is here.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.340
Help me get rid of him.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.900
Mr. Lin.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.180
Well, Mr. Lin.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.340
Are you avoiding me?

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.340
(Escaping is shameful and useless.)

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.780
(Escaping is useless and shameful.)

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.000
(To stop it from getting worse)

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.540
(and correct Mr. Lin's misconception,)

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.260
(I need him to think I'm crazy.)

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.380
Oh, Mr. Lin,

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.860
blessings upon you.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.740
My goodness,

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.740
how could I be avoiding you?

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.180
You must be busy,

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.900
yet you came.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.020
May I ask

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.500
what you want?

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:39.620
Has your cold

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.260
worsened?

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.900
Don't worry.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.260
The cold is completely gone.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.980
I'm as strong

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.940
as an old workhorse now.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.620
Mr. Lin, there's no need
for extra concern.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.220
You're distancing yourself from me.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.620
Mr. Lin,

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.940
of course not.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.740
But superiors and subordinates

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.660
should maintain their distinctions.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.260
But you're not my subordinate.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.700
My respected old friend,

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.900
I was wrong.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.980
We should observe

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.660
the proper order of seniority.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.660
We're of similar age.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.900
My goodness.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.020
I forgot about the rule
between men and women.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.780
The people in our state
have never had that rule.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.540
What's wrong with you?

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.100
In any case,

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.860
it's better

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.780
for you and me

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.820
to keep some distance.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.940
Auntie suddenly came and said

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.740
that you have to move out,

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.820
because she's afraid
people will gossip about us.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.060
When you first moved in,

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.420
did you ever consider rumors?

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.220
I've never cared about them.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.060
Why the sudden change?

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.700
Do you really want to avoid me?

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.300
Shen Shaoguang,

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.460
I want an answer.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.060
Yes.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.900
I want to avoid you.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.060
What's wrong?

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.020
Why?

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.100
I just find you annoying.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.940
Is that not allowed?

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.740
The previous oversteps

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.940
were my fault.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.220
I apologize to you.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.900
From now on,

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.060
I will do as you wish

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.900
and keep my distance from you.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:47.220

Face-sized chicken cutlet)
