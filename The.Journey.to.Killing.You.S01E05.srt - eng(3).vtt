00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
(25 years ago)
(Episode 5)

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.920
Look, look!

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.830
I leveled up.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.960
A black belt! That's amazing.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.280
Great job.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.930
He's really something, isn't he?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.200
Hey, karate isn't for fighting.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.280
Got it?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.920
Fighting is just violence.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.790
Ah, you need to remember that.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.450
Ah...

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.640
You'll get it next time.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.540
Yes, sir.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.710
Mm-hmm.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.140
Hey, you're really something.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.450
That's incredible.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.350
You leveled up just like that.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.500
Dad gave Kataoka a smile I'd never seen him give me.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.200
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.440
- Good work.
- Keep it up.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.670
- Good work!
- You too!

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.380
All right, then.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.820
Anyone who wants to hit up a hostess club for round two...

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.180
Yes, please!

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.480
What a bunch of idiots.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.040
Kataoka-san, great work.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.580
You too.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.190
We've got some great new girls in today.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.270
Maybe next time.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.920
We'll be waiting for you.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.130
Kin-san~

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.690
- How've you been?
- Never better.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.960
- Take care.
- You too.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.420
- Oh, Takuma.
- Sir.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.660
How's your mom?

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.610
I haven't been back to see her lately...

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.830
You should go show your face every once in a while.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.010
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.580
Here, take this.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.020
Thank you so much.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.130
All right, let's go.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920
- Good work.
- You too.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.470
Even outside the family, I was always watching Kataoka.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.330
Kataoka.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.720
Are you trying to take everything from me?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.300
"The Journey to Killing You"

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.700
(Last Will and Testament)

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.140
As I'm sure you all know,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.930
this family was built by the late boss himself.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.500
He literally,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.320
built it drop by drop with his own blood.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.920
He put his life on the line to carve out this territory.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.550
In here,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.730
are his final words.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.880
This family...

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.030
who is to inherit it...

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.720
it's all written clearly in here.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.810
This guy...
He just transferred to our family.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.030
What the hell! It's an assassin!

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.730
He infiltrated us!

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.920
He's after Kataoka!

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.520
Get him!

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.020
Kataoka-san.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.660
I've been...

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.850
thinking about something.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.520
Kataoka-san, you're so damn cool.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.730
Odajima.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.300
Use this to go get some sushi.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.060
I've got the look, right? Just like Kataoka-san?

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.210
Not at all.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.560
No, come on, look.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.150
Don't I have that big-shot aura too?

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.990
Kataoka-san is just so cool.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.070
Can I become like him?

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.680
Tell me, can I?

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.720
Impossible.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.370
Impossible? Why would you say that?

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.370
Why...?

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.570
There's no way you could ever be like him.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.150
Odajima.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.970
Kataoka-san said...

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.870
he wants me to join him on the job tonight.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.660
Oh man, do you think he's got his eye on me?

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.670
If this job goes well,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.960
Odajima,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.300
I'll put in a good word for you...
so he'll bring you along next time.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.570
When we make it to the top,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.410
let's build a house together.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.150
Why Asahi?

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.680
Hey, are you even listening to me?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.830
Stop! Don't run!

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.740
Asahi!

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.800
Something happened!

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.020
Something's happened!

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.290
Asahi!

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.220
Asahi!

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200
Asahi!

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.610
You said I was family...

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.500
but in your heart, is Kataoka that important?

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.590
Asahi!

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.050
You left me here.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.600
But...

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.440
I finally understand.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.880
Ah, so that's how it is.

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:39.990
You've got to be kidding me.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.570
Boss.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.240
So that's what this was all about...

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.660
Asahi.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.750
It's just that...

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.310
my body moved on its own.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.400
That's all it was.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.310
Kataoka-san?

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:35.970
Kataoka-san!

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.500
That hurts...

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.210
The wound in my stomach had just finished healing,

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.190
and now there's another hole in it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Why?

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.880
Why did you protect me?

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.250
I had to protect you.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.020
You're my...

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.030
beloved wife.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.540
Come to think of it,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.260
I think this is... our first kiss.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.750
Kataoka-san.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.990
Kataoka-san!

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.530
You bastard!

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.220
Are you kidding me?

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.390
Boss.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.890
Kataoka-san.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.220
The man who attacked Kataoka has been dealt with.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.080
Kataoka's condition is still not looking good.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.920
Did you find out who was behind it?

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.760
It would've been better if he'd just died.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.790
Fourth Generation.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.180
You're finally willing to tell your parents...

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.690
how you truly feel.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.370
No.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.540
Perhaps we were too hard on you.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160
Keito.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.680
I want you to read this carefully and take it to heart.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.480
Understand how he's always felt about you.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.170
That's not right.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.810
Dad only ever had eyes for Kataoka.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.490
He may have been clumsy,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.250
but he was always watching over you.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.470
But maybe he was just too clumsy about it.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.830
(I, the testator Kirii Seizo, upon my death,
establish the following will

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.830
to maintain order in this family and peace among my clan.)

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.590
(Successor to Head of the Kirii Family,
Fourth Generation: Kirii Keito)

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.110
Kataoka is...

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.850
the son of my father's mistress, right?

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.620
That is absolutely not true.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.960
Kataoka's father...

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.010
in a conflict...

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.300
sacrificed his life to protect the late boss.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.300
His wife,

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.500
loved only her late husband.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.410
The late boss...

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.570
was simply looking after
his best friend's orphaned son, Kataoka,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.870
and his mother.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.950
That's all there was to it.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.900
I could never stand the guy.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.950
He was better than me at everything.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.880
And I could never figure out what he was thinking.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.770
But Dad...

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.510
he cared more for that guy than for me.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.390
Even so, the late boss...

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.030
was always watching over you.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.090
And...

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.580
he wanted you to be his successor.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.150
He said it all the time.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.740
I never heard him say that.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.030
We told you many times.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.350
Many times.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.660
It was you who...

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.530
refused to believe it.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.620
Kataoka-san.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400
Hm?

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.540
You'll die if you go.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.650
Then let's do it one last time.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:49.820
One last time.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.650
You have to cherish your wife.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.050
We'll talk more when I get back.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:33.930
Kataoka-san.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.960
Please wake up.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.430
Kataoka-san.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.660
Kataoka-san.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100
Kataoka-san.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.640
Kataoka-san! Someone!

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.020
Somebody!

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.170
- Kataoka-san!
- What's wrong?

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.000
Kataoka-san.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.080
Kataoka-san?

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.270
Kataoka-san.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.280
Can you hear me?

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.130
What's happening?

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.400
Kataoka-san.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.320
- Kataoka-san, Kataoka-san!
- Go get the doctor, quickly!

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.570
- We're going in. Excuse us.
- Right.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.260
Kataoka-san...

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.830
That's Odajima.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.370
He's been with my old man for a long time.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.720
He's good with the books.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.680
He's all yours. Take him with you.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240
Yo.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.310
Odajima.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.060
You're always clumsy in the most unexpected ways.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.080
Don't you dare mess this up.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.400
Seriously...

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.020
You're so cold.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.500
Let's get married.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.360
I have to take responsibility.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.470
Because I'm a man.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:44.300
Please... don't die.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.540
Because...

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.080
you...

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.390
You're...

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.770
my...

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.240
reason...

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.970
for living.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
(Final Episode)

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.800
I always

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.420
have the same dream.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.610
A dream of flying through the air.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.440
A world of pure white.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.800
A completely empty sky.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.220
Flying aimlessly everywhere.
