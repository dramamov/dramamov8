(Previously on "Player")

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.320
What if she actually starts to like you? What will you do?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.840
Ploy is like a flower that lures in insects.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.480
Just a sweet glance from her, and people swarm.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.000
For your first time, Pun.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.400
It would be better to look for
someone less player than Ploy.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.160
If you fall for her, watch your heart.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.960
Of all your ex-flings,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.200
Golf is back home now. Did you know?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
If you want to know about Phe, get in!

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.000
“For me, design is about
creating memories.”

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.280
“And lasting impressions.”

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.320
“Come to think of it”

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.320
“Even before I became a graphic designer,”

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.520
“My life had always been about

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.880
making the people I love feel special.”

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.440
“But somehow,”

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.000
“Every time I tried to impress someone,”

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.840
“I ended up being saved instead.”

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.560
Having fun? Let’s go.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.880
“They always came to save me.”

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.640
Did you color it wrong?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.600
I’ll help you. Which part?

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.760
This one.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.200
"This time was no different."

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200
“This time, I won’t let you fall.”

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.280
Pun, get back in the car.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.400
Pun, please wait in my car first.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.520
Pun!

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.640
Got connections?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.760
Huh?

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.720
I asked if you have any connections?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.640
Are you someone’s son
from a powerful family?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.160
I know you’re an actress.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.440
So, are you threatening me right now?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.840
This could make headlines.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.720
Assault and kidnapping...

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.920
What’s the sentence for that?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.560
I really didn’t want to get involved,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.600
But she didn’t seem to want to go with you.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.960
Then stay out of it.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.200
Spend your time

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.920
learning to drive instead.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.600
You might wanna spend yours
to find some good backup.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
Because her father
is the Commissioner General.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.320
He won't just sit back
if his daughter’s been taken.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.640
Wanna end up in jail?

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.600
[Tsk!, signs]

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.120
Let’s head back, Pun.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.800
Pun.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.840
Uh…

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.720
Thanks for saving me again.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.640
No problem.
Guess I was just passing by at the right time.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.480
Right! It’s destiny!

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.760
“This is my chance.”

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.240
So, are you free tomorrow, Ploy?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.560
I’d love to treat you to a meal
to say thanks.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.800
Hmm

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.880
I’m not free tomorrow.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.240
What about later this week then?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.920
I’m busy every day, actually.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.840
Well, technically,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.240
I do have a little free time
tomorrow morning.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.720
When exactly?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.280
I’m making merit downstairs at 6 a.m.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.280
You could join me,
returning the favor.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.760
6 in the morning?

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.880
“She wakes up that early?”

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.560
Fine, I’ll be there.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.480
See you at 6, Ploy.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.400
Okay.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.480
Well then…

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.240
I’ll get going.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.720
Good night.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.240
Here’s my number
or just add me on Line.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.880
"In case we need to pick a meeting spot."

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.840
["Miss Sweetie"]

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.640
I’ve got you now, Miss Sweetie.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.520
Damn it, Pun!

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.200
Why didn’t you set an alarm?

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.000
Hey, I did! You just slept through it!

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.560
“Made merit for you already. Sleep well, sleepyhead.”

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.560
Ughhh!

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.880
Ughhh!

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.600
Jay

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.960
What are you up to?

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.800
Just looking for something.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.120
What is it? Want me to help?

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.840
It’s okay.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.720
I can’t find it anywhere.
I have to go out and buy it.

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:36.480
Perfect! I’ll come with you.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.720
Didn’t you have plans with your friends today?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.000
They texted me last night,
Turns out they’re all busy.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.800
So I’m free now.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.360
Babe, you want to stay in today?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.920
I'll go out and grab you something.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.320
Nah, I’ll tag along.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.280
Being stuck in the room is boring.
Let’s go shopping together!

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.120
Please? Can I?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.400
Pleeease?

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.120
Please?

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.560
Okay?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.800
Fine.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.320
Let me grab my bag first.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.520
Okay.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.480
I really want to check out this new café.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.840
It’s by the garden, near the fountain.
Just opened.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.440
Take me there for some photos?

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.919
Sure.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.240
Oof, my stomach hurts.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.880
I’m gonna hit the restroom real quick.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.080
You go first
and wait at the shop, okay?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.160
I’ll meet you there, Prang!

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.280
Hey Jay, wait!

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.720
What’s up with her?

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.040
“If I wanna win her heart,
I've gotta use what she loves most.”

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.680
These ones. Perfect.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.920
Pretty, sexy, and totally irresistible.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.560
How may I help you?

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.720
“40 thousand!?”

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.160
“Pun, your taste’s a little too fancy.”

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.960
Huh?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.680
Uh… I’ll just take a look around first.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.320
Sure.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.120
Pun!

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.000
Oh, Prang!

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.440
Shopping for shoes?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.200
Uh… yeah, kind of.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.440
I’ll take the pair she picked.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.120
Size 35, please.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.560
Of course.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.840
Wait, Prang

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.040
They're too expensive.
I can’t pay you back for that.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.920
Just think of them
as a welcome-back gift from me.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.080
Have you found a job yet?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.760
Still… looking.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.400
I actually have some friends
in your field.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.920
Want me to ask around?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.600
Heh, no thanks.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.440
I can manage on my own.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.600
Have you gone home
to see parents lately?

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.560
I just went back to pick up my car.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.000
Did you get to see them?

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.760
I was in a rush that day.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.480
They’re probably worried about you.
Maybe give them a call.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.680
Yeah, I know.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.040
Once I’m done with a few things,
I’ll go see them.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.280
Here you go.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.120
Thank you.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.960
Mhm.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.320
Thanks, Prang.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.120
If you ever need help with anything,
just let me know.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.320
No, no, really.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.920
I’m fine.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.800
Yeah right, like I’m actually okay.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.320
Thanks so much.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.600
Take care of it for me, okay? Bye!

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.720
Get home safe.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.680
Hey, Jay!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.880
Who was that?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.280
My friend.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.800
Just a friend, huh?

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.480
You’re not flirting again, are you?

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.880
She’s really just a friend.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.120
Anyway, what are you doing here?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.160
Shopping.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.240
And I ran into Prang.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.360
Oh, Prang! I’m actually meeting her.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.000
She’s waiting for me now. I’d better go.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.720
Bye-bye!

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.160
If I find out you’re lying,
I’m telling Prang.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.960
Have you been waiting long?

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.040
The bathroom line was crazy.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.960
No, not at all.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.520
Is anything wrong?

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.200
Huh?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.960
Nothing. I just went to the restroom.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.600
No,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.360
I mean Pun. I just saw her.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.160
Pun? Really?

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.520
Yeah, I ran into her just now.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.240
Is something going on?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.080
I don’t know.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.520
I just feel like

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.280
she’s going through something.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.640
Don’t worry too much, Prang.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.960
She’s just stressed about finding a job.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.120
She’s grown up now.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.560
Let her handle it.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.880
I just hope it’s only about the job.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.600
Whoa, those cakes look so good.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.280
You ordered everything I like!

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.480
This drink’s amazing.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.320
Really?

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.400
Let's try this one.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.800
“I miss you.”

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.160
I wonder if Ploy will like it.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.960
I’ve got you now!

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.680
Miss Sweetie.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.760
Oh, Prang.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.320
What are you doing?

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.480
Nothing.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.720
What about tomorrow morning?

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.360
What will you do?

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.360
Why?

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.760
I’d invite you to make merit.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.200
What time?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.520
Meet me outside the room.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.080
6 a.m.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.680
What? 6 a.m.?

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.960
I’m busy.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.560
Busy doing what?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.560
Uh...

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.040
Sleeping.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.600
You should do some merit for once.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.480
Train that lazy mind of yours to be kind.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.880
No thanks. I’m tired.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.160
So sleepy.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.200
Come on, Pun.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.000
Ploy invited us herself.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.360
I don’t want us to seem rude.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.160
Alright?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.480
Hmm.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840
I’ll go.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.560
Good.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.040
Let's go to bed early, then.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.600
Okay.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.040
“I’ll set an alarm every 10 minutes.”

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.040
"Let’s see if I’d sleep through that."

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.320
See you tomorrow,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.440
Ploy!

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.760
Heh… I’ve got you now.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.880
[laughs]

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.560
I’ve got you now! Hahaha!

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.160
Miss.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.400
Please prepare your offering.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.480
Pun.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.040
Pun.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.360
Pun!

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.440
I’ve got you now!

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.560
Morning already?

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.720
Please offer your alms.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.000
Now pour water to dedicate the merit.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.480
[chanting]

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:56.960
Ploy,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.800
Is this why you like making merit?

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.400
Hmm… I’m not that religious, really.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.000
I just think merit-making is
a kind of mental practice.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.600
One that shows its effects quickly.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.440
And

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.320
Do you believe in past and future lives, Ploy?

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.360
I don’t know.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.960
I guess I’ll have to die first
before I can tell you.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.440
Then come back and
tell me in lotto numbers, okay?

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.120
Three digits;
exact ones, please.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.080
But honestly

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.440
It’s better not to wait for the next life.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.120
Do good things for each other
in this one instead.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.800
Like

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.120
Sharing my umbrella with a sleepyhead

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.480
Who didn’t bring anything.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.280
Who knows?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.120
We might keep running into each other.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.720
"Who knows?"

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.600
"We might keep running into each other."

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.400
Good deeds never go unrewarded, it’s real.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.320
Pun: "What are you up to, Ploy?"

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.400
“Thanks again for today.”

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.400
“Girls! Emergency!”

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.680
“I’m about to text Ploy, to flirt!”

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.000
“How should I start?”

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.680
Best: “Gosh. She’s right next door.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.360
Just go to her room!”

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.080
“We’re not that close yet.”

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.800
Chakrit: “Then make it happen,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.880
get close tonight!”

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.280
“How?”

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.880
Wanjieab: “Are you sick or something, Pun?”

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.240
“When it’s a guy you like,”

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.600
“you’re never this shy.”

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.360
“Just flirt with her
the way you flirt with men!”

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.080
“It’s not the same.”

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.120
“What do you mean it’s not the same?”

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.000
“Normally, guys are the ones
who come to me.”

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.520
"And when I flirted with them,”

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.440
“I never felt this nervous.”

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.840
“I don’t know how to act.”

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.440
“I can’t tell what’s too much or too little.”

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.040
“What if she thinks I’m weird… or too much?”

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.960
“Pun, why do you care this much?”

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.600
“Seriously, this is so not like you.”

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.880
"From the way you’re acting"

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.440
“Don’t tell me
you’ve actually fallen for her.”

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.040
“That’s game over, girl.”

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.800
“If you fall for your own target.”

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.840
“Oh, what a waste of time.”

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.280
“Stop nitpicking me!”

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.720
“Give me something useful!”

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.840
“Go for a soft,"

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.880
"no-makeup makeup look.”

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.520
“But bold lips. And a short skirt.”

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.880
"Show off your best assets"

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.760
“But keep that sweet and innocent vibe.”

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.600
“Then go to her room.”

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.720
“Ask her out! Dinner, a play, whatever.”

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.960
“Just don’t make it sound too plain.”

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.280
“Use what your mama gave you.”

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.920
“Maybe ‘accidentally’ show a little cleavage
just enough to tease."

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.400
"Or touch her arm a little."

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.200
“Do you have a version that’s less terrifying?”

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.160
“Something not so aggressive?”

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.800
“Pun, where did your confidence go?”

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.920
"Is it gone?”

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.960
“If you wanna win, bring it back.”

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.920
“Just be yourself.”

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.400
“Look at Ploy the way you’d look at
any of your flings.”

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.200
“She’s not that special. That’s it.
Case closed.”

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.960
"Whatever!"

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:06.960
Alright. Here goes.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.400
“I had a great time making merit today.”

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.440
“It really made me feel at peace.”

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.160
(Pun: “I had a great time making merit today.
It really made me feel at peace.”)

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.560
Ugh, read it today or tomorrow.
Whatever. Up to you.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.400
Who even cares.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.400
Hmph.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.520
“So… have you conquered her heart yet, babe?”

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.000
“If you still don’t know how,
come train in my room first.”

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.600
What now?

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.600
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.120
Okay.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880
That’s it?

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.120
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.040
Still nothing.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.320
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.400
Still nothing!

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.080
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.200
Still.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.440
Still no reply?

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.840
No reply… no reply…

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.520
She’s really not replying.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.640
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.760
You’re really not gonna text back,
huh, Ploy?

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.160
“Why isn’t she replying?! Reply, reply, reply!”

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.880
You’re really not gonna answer,
are you, Ploy?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.760
Ploy: “Wanna go again?”

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.200
Let’s wait 3 minutes.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.680
Three

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920
Two

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:01.960
One

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.480
Screw it. I’m texting her!

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.120
Pun: “Going where?”

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.240
Ploy: “To make merit.”

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.320
Pun: “Mind if I come along?”

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.440
Ploy: “Not gonna bail on me again
for oversleeping, right?”

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.480
“Can I answer that with actions instead?”

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.160
“Then give me your answer
on the next Buddhist holy day.”

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.680
"6 a.m., outside my door.”

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.200
“Can I give my answer before that day?”

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.840
(Ploy: “?”)

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.960
“I found a nice restaurant online.”

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.080
"I’d love to take you there.”

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.360
Ahem.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.680
Hello?

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.440
Hello?

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.760
Hello, Ploy?

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.720
You’re asking me out, right?

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.240
I just wanted to thank you
for helping me that day.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.720
Let me see the place first.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.520
What if I don’t show you, you won’t go?

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.360
Should I go?

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.600
I’d really like you to.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.320
I’m free tonight.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.160
Meet me in the lobby in 30 minutes.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.240
Okay!

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.640
Oh, crap! I don’t even have a place yet!

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.320
Find one now, Pun!

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.760
Do you like this place, Ploy?

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.560
I do.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.840
Good choice.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.440
I just found out

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.760
You’re the one who taught Prang how to cook.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.680
She forced me to.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.400
Have you ever thought about
opening your own restaurant?

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.640
I noticed you seemed to love cooking too.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.000
I like cooking for people close to me more.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.040
My brother opened one,
and it looked like way too much work.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:31.920
"Oh"

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.160
"It's time."

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.200
I never knew you had a brother.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.560
Yes, an older one.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.920
He runs a restaurant in New York.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.280
New York?

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.280
I just came back from there.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.440
What’s it called? Maybe I’ve heard of it.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.240
Let’s Eat Thai.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.440
It’s in Brooklyn. Know it?

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.760
Hmm. I'm not sure actually.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.480
So

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.880
Have you ever been to
your brother’s restaurant?

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:09.880
Yeah.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.200
But it’s been a while.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.080
Are you two close?

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.600
I’m close with everyone who’s cute.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.640
Well...

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.440
When I was in New York,

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.840
I actually thought about
opening a Thai restaurant too.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.120
It’s a shame, really.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.080
I didn’t know anything about running one.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.000
Would’ve been nice to have someone to guide me.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.320
By the way

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.600
Does your brother ever come back to Thailand?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.560
I’d love to see the two of you cooking together.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.040
He just got back.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.320
And if I...

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.720
You ran out of my question quota for tonight.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.160
Mind if I ask one instead?

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.440
Do you like women?

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.120
Like them or not,

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.800
That depends on who’s asking.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.120
And if I’m the one asking?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.560
You’re looking at me like I’m a kid, Ploy.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.720
I don’t even realize I’m doing it.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.720
But technically

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.080
I am older than you, Pun.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.840
And that look in your eyes,

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.320
It’s like you’re staring at someone
who still hasn’t grown up.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.840
You didn’t answer my question.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.160
I did. I’ve answered everything you asked.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.600
I asked

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.960
if you like women.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.360
Was that too hard of a question?

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.440
Ploy,

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.960
I prefer answering with actions, not words.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.640
If you really want to know

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.800
then we’ll have to see each other more often.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.160
Oh shoot.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.640
My phone’s dead.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.280
Here.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.440
Ploy,

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.320
I’ll go charge it and transfer the money back to you.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.560
It’s alright.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.040
Dinner’s on me tonight.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.080
Are you mad at me?

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.960
I’m mad at myself.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.800
Then why the pouty face?

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.480
I wanted to treat you, but you wouldn’t let me.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.520
I’m free next week too.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.640
Really?

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.960
I’ll make a list of things you need to buy.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.360
To make up for dinner being on me tonight.
I’ll send it to you in chat.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.400
If that’s okay,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.720
come over to my place.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.600
Okay.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.840
Okay.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:31.840
Thank you.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.080
Like this.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:36.840
Mhm.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.200
Like this.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.400
No.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.200
Here, slice it thinner. Like this.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.440
Ah, got it.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.200
Careful with your fingers.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.680
This is so weird.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.360
Why’d you suddenly ask Prang to teach you how to cook?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.160
So I can make my own meals sometimes.
Saves money, Jay.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.720
You make it sound like you’re broke.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.400
Broke? What?

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.280
You’re the one who said

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.840
saving up a little wouldn’t hurt.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.800
Sure, sure.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.400
I thought maybe
you were learning to cook for someone.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.240
Nope.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360
No one to cook for.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.000
Oh, Pun.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.560
This looks so awful.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.080
Who’d even eat this?
None of the pieces are the same size.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.200
They are the same!

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.600
No, they’re not.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.520
They totally are.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.440
None of them look good.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.160
They’re good!

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.160
Oh!

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.840
Your face’s covered in vitamins.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:40.840
Not funny.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.600
Babe.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.080
Hey.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.840
Did you get everything?

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.120
Yep, all set.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:28.360
But

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:32.880
All of this still doesn’t even come close
to half of what you paid for dinner.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.760
It’s alright.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.120
I was thinking,
should we invite Jay and Prang to join us?

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.679
Well...

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.280
If you’d rather have company tonight, that’s fine.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.800
Go ahead and invite them if you want.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.920
Does that mean

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.560
You’d like me to?

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.520
Sure. The more, the merrier, right?

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.160
Actually, no.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.560
I’ve changed my mind.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.600
Why’s that?

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.360
Because it’ll just give me a headache.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.440
Two sisters cooking together...

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.240
Come on, let me help.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.760
Let’s see what you bought.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.000
This one.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.720
And two of these, right?

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.480
Mhm.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.680
Good job.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.920
Do you like reading, Ploy?

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.160
I do.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.160
But lately I’ve been busy.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.880
Hardly have time to read anymore.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.840
Books just end up sitting on the shelf.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.240
Hmm… in that case.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.000
Do you like movies?

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.560
I watched some, yeah.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.080
Then...

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.560
Wanna go see a movie?

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.560
I heard there’s a new horror film out.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.080
Looks really good.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.880
You’re asking me to see a horror movie?

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.000
So

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.840
Are you coming or not?

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.160
Will you at least buy me popcorn?

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.080
Hmm

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.240
You can even hold my hand

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.800
if you get scared.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.160
I’ll think about it.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.560
How about 9 p.m.?

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.480

Okay.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.960
I’ll book it then.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.480

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.920
The movie, the popcorn,

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.520
and the drinks?

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.120
Yup. I’m older, remember?

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.000
You always use age as an excuse.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.960
Next time, you’re treating me

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.360
to Omakase.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.040
Wow, then you should probably call me

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.880
'Daddy Ploy'.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:48.920
Ploy!

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.560
I’m not a sugar baby, you know.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.320
I might be younger,
but I can take care of the grown-up one too.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.720
Ploy,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.400
Do you ever feel uncomfortable

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.360
When people stare at you like that?

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.240
As an actress,

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.400
If no one noticed me at all,
I’d probably be even more stressed.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.640
Shall we go?

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.400
Which theater are we in?

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.880
I won't tell you.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.480
I just want you to follow me.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.200
This kid...

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.400
Shouldn’t have trusted you with the tickets.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.600
You can hold my hand,

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.760
if you’re afraid of getting lost.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.720
Ploy.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.760
Hm?

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.440
Aren’t you cold?

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.000
No, I’m fine.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.160
“Hold her hand.”

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.120
“Move closer, Pun. Come on. Don’t be shy.”

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.320
[screams from the movie]

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.560
Pun.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:29.720
Yeah?

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.880
I’m scared of ghosts.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.240
I told you,

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.040
If you got scared, you could hold my hand.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.040
But it takes half the movie for you

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.000
To finally get scared.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.520
You’re not scared, Pun?

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.120
I was terrified 10 minutes in.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.920
Those sneakers look cute on you, by the way.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.920
Well, this way, we’re the same height.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.320
If you keep staring like that,

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.040
you’re gonna make me nervous.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.160
Well, you’re just too cute, Ploy.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.360
By the way,

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.480
Were you really scared of the ghosts?

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.760
Why do you ask?

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.320
Well, maybe,

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.520
you were just pretending,
so you could hold my hand.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.160
Like how you pretended
to look for your earring in my room?

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.280
What?

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.880
Wait, what are you talking about?

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.000
I cleaned every corner of my room, Pun.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.560
Your little tricks still need some work.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.400
Well, I didn’t know you’d be so..

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.000
It’s fine.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.360
It’s actually kind of cute.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.480
Um, Ploy,

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.280
I have something for you.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:48.800
Here.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.320
I knew you liked these,
so I bought them for you.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.600
Thank you.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.760
Open it.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.520
Size 35?

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.080
“That’s my size. Prang ordered that, didn’t she?”

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.640
I’ll take the pair she picked. Size 35, please.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.560
I’m sorry.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.000
It’s alright.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.480
I attentively picked them for you after all.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.320
Even if they don’t fit...

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.360
I’m just happy you thought of me.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.280
Even if I can't wear them,

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.520
I’ll keep them safe.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.680
It's so lovely.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.480
Do you like butterflies, Pun?

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.520
Not really.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.080
But lately, I don’t know why,

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.760
I’ve been thinking about butterflies a lot.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:00.200
I was planning to fold a bunch of them,
and stick them together into a big collage.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:03.920
Oh, that’s right.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.520
Prang once mentioned that you like art.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.560
You’re a graphic designer, aren’t you?

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.400
That’s really lovely.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.200
I like that.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:26.920
Hmm...

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.440
Can I try folding one too?

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.120
Hm?

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.840
Will you teach me?

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.120
Sure, of course.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.240
I actually brought some paper.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:41.880
Come here.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.480
I’ll show you.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.200
“I’ve always believed good design
is about creating lasting impressions.”

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.000
“Even before I became a graphic designer.”

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:59.200
“my life has always revolved around
making the people I love feel special.”

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.200
“I’ve worked so hard,
pouring everything I have into it."

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.080
“Just to impress someone.”

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.880
Hope the proposal goes smoothly, Jay.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.800
Prang’s really lucky to have you.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.680
“But somewhere along the way”

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.120
“I forgot something important; clients.”

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.960
“The people I actually wanted to impress.”

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.840
“I should’ve tried to understand them deeply.”

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.320
"To understand the deeper feelings and values within."

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.200
“What kind of value really moves them?”

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:43.120
“What kind of meaning brings out that kind of smile?”

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.080
“I want to understand it better.”

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.520
“I want to see

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.160
that smile again.”

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.600
Done.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.560
Let’s see.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.880
It's beautiful.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.400
Of course.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.240
Then I’ll put this one

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.960
right in the center of my collage.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.440
Go ahead.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.760
Compare it with the teacher’s, then.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.160
Well, the teacher’s is a bit bigger.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:00.760
"Actually,"

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.000
“It’s quite strange."

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.640
"Maybe, Ploy knows more about Phetai than she lets on."

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:08.960
Phe?

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:16.040
