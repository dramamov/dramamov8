00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.440
Stop calling me King Chaiyached.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.680
And stop using royal language with me.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.360
The king once known as King Chaiyached
has left this world.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.920
Only the commoner named Jade remains.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.240
As expected.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.200
Somdet Saenyakorn seeks
to crown himself king.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.440
You intend to storm the Grand Palace?

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.720
If you need my help, just say so.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.200
I must ask Lady Nisa

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.160
to deceive Somdet first
so he suspects another plan.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.680
Then we’ll march like the Natasha troops.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.759
Slip in quietly and take down
the mastermind alone.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.640
Hey, Worradej.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.320
Once we step into the Grand Palace,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.520
we can’t keep bickering like this.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160
Walls have ears, doors have eyes.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.480
Every step we take is dangerous.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.400
Do you realize that?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.360
Mm.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.000
I know.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.320
Hey, Kosol.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.640
You’ve been away from the palace so long.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.560
Aren’t you excited to go home?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.120
A home filled only with hatred among kin.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.040
It’s like living in a blaze.
I don’t wish to return.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.480
Once our mission is complete,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.320
there will be no more of it,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.800
no more killing or fighting for power.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.560
It’s drawing near, Worradej.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.120
What is?

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.160
My wish,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.760
the one you once asked me about.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.480
It’s about to come true.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.920
Really?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.040
Then when that wish of yours comes true,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.480
we’ll finally go home, won’t we?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.280
I wonder how things are back there now.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.960
This is quite an unusual case.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.600
All of the patient’s body indexes
are perfectly normal,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.480
yet we still can’t find the cause

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.960
of why the patient hasn’t woken up.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.720
It’s as if they simply fell asleep.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.440
Is there any way to wake him up?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.680
Any method at all,
I'll pay whatever it takes.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.760
Doctors from several departments

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.320
are currently discussing this case.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.480
By the way,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.000
have you reached
the patient’s parents yet, Nat?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.760
Because if surgery becomes necessary,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.280
The parents must sign
a consent form first.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.200
Prince’s parents live abroad.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.320
And more importantly,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.000
they’ve already cut ties with him.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.360
They couldn’t accept who he truly is.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.480
Ah, I see. I understand.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.600
In that case,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.760
our team will look into
alternative treatments

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.160
that don’t require surgery.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.280
Okay.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.120
Alright then, I’ll take my leave now.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.399
- Sure.
- Yes, doctor.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.360
Prince.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.200
Wake up, man.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.440
Where the hell did you go party off to?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.600
Ugh!

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.760
I’m really worried here.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.680
Ta-da!

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.440
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.600
The outfits are here!

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.920
What kind of outfit is that?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.680
The ones we’ll use to sneak
into the Grand Palace.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.080
Have you gone mad?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.120
That’s the cloth women use
as a shawl, isn’t it?

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.520
Exactly!

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.440
We’ll disguise ourselves as royal maids.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.760
And sneak into the palace dressed as women.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.120
- Dressed as women?
- Dressed as women?!

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.600
- No way.
- Nope.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.480
No refusing.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.640
To get into the Grand Palace,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.200
and reach the royal inner court,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.320
we have no choice but to go in as women.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.680
Or would you rather

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.800
turn into flies and buzz your way inside?

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.480
That’s actually true.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.600
If you refuse to dress up, then stay.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.960
I’ll go alone.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.680
I’ve always wanted to try once,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.000
see what it’s like dressing as a woman.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.520
You? Absolutely not.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.760
Fine, whatever.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.440
For the kingdom and the nation.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.040
I’ll cross-dress this once in my life.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.240
Fabulous!

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.680
You’re the cutest, my darling.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.480
I bet when you’re in women’s clothes,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.480
you’ll totally pull off
that fierce-lady vibe.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.040
One hundred percent.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.080
But once we wear these shawls...

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.960
Will people really believe
we’re women?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.360
Our hair isn’t even long enough.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.480
I’ve got just the thing, sir.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.600
Here it is.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.320
I bought it from a Japanese
wig craftsman.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.280
He said it’s made
from real human hair.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.600
Made from real hair, you say?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.800
Yes, sir.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.120
Magnificent.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.120
Lift.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.600
Swing.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.120
Now walk.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.080
Left.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.600
Right.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.040
Hips.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.560
Hips.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.159
Hips.

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.680
Hips.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.960
Hips.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.520
Hips!

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.280
I told you, use your hips!

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.520
Swing them with a little sass!

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.360
Move like true palace ladies,
graceful and elegant!

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.159
I am using them!

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.360
Come on, keep walking!

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.080
Left, right.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.800
Left, hips.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.280
Hips.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.800
Hips , Banjong, fabulous!

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.920
Fabulous!

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.720
Flick your wrist, Banjong.
Flick your wrist!

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.320
Yes, make it graceful , hips!

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.440
Hips.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.680
Use your hands.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.880
Hands, come on.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.280
Hips, hips.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.160
Hips , swing your arms, Banjong.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.480
Hips...

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.240
Hey, Banjong.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.080
Come play sepak takraw with me.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.960
I’ve been itching to move for ages.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.080
Yeah, I wanna kick
till my legs give out.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.000
Break them if I have to!

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.360
- Chit, you coming too?
- Yeah!

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:54.920
Alright, back to rehearsal.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.840
Full turn , spin back, come on!

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.920
Then left, right.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.440
Left, right.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.240
Hips, hips.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.680
Hips.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.960
Hips.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.400
Hips.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.800
Hips.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.240
Hips.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.960
Hips , come on, hips!

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.840
That’s it. Now listen.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.040
If some old pervert tries to flirt,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.320
what are we supposed to do?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.480
Grab his collar and punch him!

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.640
No, no!

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.159
You must glance shyly.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.679
Then act all modest like this.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.039
You can’t just punch him!

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.679
Now try it , quick!

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.720
A bit more flutter in those eyes.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.080
How’s that?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.640
Perfect!

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.840
Now try tucking your hair
behind your ear.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.200
Go on, tuck it.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.520
Oh my!

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.200
So sweet.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.520
Sweet enough to give me diabetes!

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.800
Hey, Kosol.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.920
Why aren’t you doing it?
Just sitting there watching.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.320
Come on, your turn!

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.440
Don’t tell me you...

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.000
You’ve fallen for Banjong.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.480
You must not fall for him.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.840
I’ll pinch you. I will not agree.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.880
- Don’t.
- I’ll pinch!

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.480
Ouch

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.640
You want me to like Banjong?
I’d rather love dogs and cats.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.200
I only look at Banjong.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.920
And it echoes in my heart.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.080
That even gentle-faced Banjong

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.280
still looks so out of place.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.440
If someone rough like me tried it,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.840
would it not be even more bizarre?

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.480
I will not do it.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.000
You cannot refuse. You must do it.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.280
Because earlier,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.840
you forced me to train with sword and gun
even though I did not want to.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.480
Now the time has come.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.600
for you to do what you do not wish to do.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.600
And if you fail...

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.080
If you dress as a woman and fail
to be demure and get caught,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.280
our mission will fail.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.320
And who decides

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.000
that women must act this way, Worradej?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.680
Women have varied manners.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.320
No need to train everyone the same.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.800
I do not despise gentle women.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.640
But I do not want to.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.400
Because it forces me.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.960
If I had been born a woman,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.480
I might not be so demure.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.600
You should understand us well.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.280
You were forced by your father too.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.080
To act more manly,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.360
even though that was not you.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.760
Ah.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.160
Then forget all that, alright?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.800
Now choose what kind of woman
you want to be.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.680
It’s up to you.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.720
Really?

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.360
Don’t... don’t hug too long.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.680
Stay here. Don’t be naughty.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.600
Just keep to your room.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.040
That shouldn’t be too hard for you, right?

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.160
I know.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.040
You may order me about like a child.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.480
Deal with Somdet quickly.
Do not keep me waiting.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.760
And importantly, do not get hurt.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.200
Then there’ll be no one left to argue with.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.760
I’m bored.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.320
Chatterbox.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.760
I’m off.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.040
Hey, Jade.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.720
Take good care of little Chaiyached.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.200
If I find anything pretty on the way
I’ll bring it back for you.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.840
As long as you return safe,

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.840
I will be glad, truly.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.120
Hey, stop crying now.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.280
Come here, quick.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.280
We’re not going to die, you know.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.760
These girls don’t die that easily.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.440
Worradej.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.520
Let us go, or we’ll be late.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.120
Good luck.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.840
Take care of yourselves.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.400
I await good news.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.320
I’m off now.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.640
Enough crying now.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.680
I’m going.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.360
Bye.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.240
Once our mission is complete,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.200
there will be no more of it.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.360
The killing and the struggle for power.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.160
It is about to come true.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.080
And when your wish is fulfilled, what then?

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.480
We will finally go home, won’t we

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.640
You have traveled many days.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.720
Was the journey smooth?

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.000
Very smooth.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.400
Why are you in such a state?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.080
Hold on tight, Worradej.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.200
Hold on tight, Worradej.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.480
Keep holding.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.520
Hold here.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.840
Hold the boat tight.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.560
There’s a whirlpool ahead.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.000
Worradej.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.640
Storms were not enough , now a whirlpool too?

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.240
Hold on tight.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.040
Hold on tight, Worradej.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.440
Worradej, hold on tight.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.960
Since the journey went well,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.000
that means

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.560
our mission will succeed.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.800
Are you ready?

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.280
If you are ready,

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.760
I will take you into the Grand Palace.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.280
Has His Majesty called an urgent meeting?

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.920
Do you know what it is about?

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.720
I heard it concerns war
with the four corner lords.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.960
They dare defy us?

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.600
Looks like this will be a great war.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.120
Who are these people, Lady Nisa?

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.760
These people will serve as my guards.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.520
Why do you question me?

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.520
Are these supposed to be women?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.080
Why are they so tall and bulky
like ogres?

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.320
Hideous indeed.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.640
And what of it? Who does it hurt?

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.280
They’re fine with themselves,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.240
so others shouldn’t,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.319
butt in.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.079
or act offended for them.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.480
Palace guards

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.000
must maintain order in the inner court.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.440
That’s why I chose strong,
tall women like them.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.160
Why must you question me?

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.000
Let them through at once.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.920
We’ve entered the inner court.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.960
You may all relax now.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.120
Everyone here is on our side.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.640
Splendid.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.880
I was so tense, I swear,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.400
walked so stiff I almost cramped up.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.040
I overheard those
two ministers talking earlier.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.000
By now, they must’ve heard the news.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.800
That our provincial forces

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.000
are marching toward the In River delta.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.280
Lady Nisa.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.920
Please gather all the royal attendants.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.800
We shall discuss the battle plan.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.920
Understood.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.960
Im.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.040
- Go fetch everyone.
- Yes, my lady.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.520
Worradej.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.960
May I change out of this gown first?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.240
I just don’t feel confident wearing it.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.200
Me neither.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.240
Why is that?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.880
You two look lovely in them.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.720
Quite graceful, I’d say.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.080
If I were a man,
I’d be courting you already.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.760
Hey, Worradej.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.240
So who would you court, me or Banjong?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.600
I’d court Banjong.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.720
Hey, Worradej!

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.640
You dare cheat on me?

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.920
Didn’t you swear you’d love only me?

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.320
Oh, come on.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.320
You’re jealous over nothing again.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.200
I said, were I a man,
(which cannot be).

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.680
Which is impossible, of course.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.680
Sigh. Very well then.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.440
If you wish to change your gown,
then change it.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.680
So then...

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.880
Follow me, please.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.080
- Quite lovely, is it not
- It is lovely

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.360
Our scouts report that

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.000
all the provincial powers

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.600
have set themselves against

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.040
our Saenya Dynasty at this hour.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.840
At present,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.480
they have marshalled their forces

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.400
at the mouth of the In River.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.920
Let every regiment of ours

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.760
mass fully to oppose them with all strength.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.680
Allow not one assault upon our capital.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.280
Now all our field armies

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.400
are departing from the royal court,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.480
leaving but a scant garrison
within these walls.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.520
We attendants now outnumber them here.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.480
If we quell every hostile province,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.800
we shall expand our realm,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.840
swallowing each province into Saenya.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.480
Thus shall we proclaim our might to them,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.680
They are mistaken.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.800
For daring to challenge us.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.080
If we succeed in this mission

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.080
we shall not be oppressed again.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.000
The order where men once ruled

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.840
will become equal for all.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.880
Everyone shall live in freedom.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.880
No one shall serve another.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.400
At this hour.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.960
Kosol has departed Singhanakhon.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.560
Likely en route to join the provinces.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.520
Give the orders.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.400
Whoever beheads him

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.080
I will promote you to general at once.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.400
- We accept with all due honor
- We accept with all due honor

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.360
And why we have gathered today

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.520
is because we have a brilliant plan

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.680
which needs each of you to assist.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.360
So it may succeed.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.280
Are you ready to join us?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.800
I stand ready.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.880
Are we ready?

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.760
Ready, my lady.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.840
Splendid.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.120
Then I will tell the plan to everyone.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.480
Kosol.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.360
I am afraid.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.000
You have me right here beside you.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.080
What is there left to fear?

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.000
I fear I may fail tomorrow.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.040
That our plan may not succeed.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.120
I fear something may happen to you.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.920
And if that were to come true,

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.920
our nation...

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.400
it would surely fall into ruin.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.480
I am so afraid, Kosol...

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.120
Remember my words.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.560
Never utter the word “fear.”

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.360
Even when your heart trembles within.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.840
Do not let anyone see the fear you hold.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.880
Not even yourself.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.840
This kiss shall be your strength.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.280
From brave as you already are,

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.320
you will be a hundred,
a thousand times braver.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.120
Ready for battle.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.680
To face every enemy head-on.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.560
This kiss will remind you.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.600
That I will always be by your side.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.240
Wherever or whenever you may be.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.760
I wonder how Lord Kosol fares now.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.080
Have you dealt with Somdet yet?

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.080
I want the turmoil in my life to end.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.080
The root of my life's chaos began then.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.360
It began the day Lord Kosol

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.360
was stripped of the viceroyalty.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.560
For being caught consorting
with a young nobleman.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.640
The crown then fell to me.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.560
At that time...

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.800
I was too naive to know what it was.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.640
I only knew that

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.600
I did not want it.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.320
Somdet Kosol,

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.160
behaved contrary to his birth sex.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.200
He engaged in relations with men.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.280
This was a grave offense.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.920
He must be stripped of rank,

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.800
reduced to commoner status,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.960
and sentenced to ten years’ prison.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.800
In the city of Singhanakhon.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.880
And my first act upon accession

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.520
was to strip my brother of title,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.680
and send him to prison in another town.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.040
Brother...

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.120
I did not want to do it.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.960
But Somdet forced my hand.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.800
I was right.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.480
To have come to Singhanakhon.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.480
Because I found my brother again.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.560
Though he pouts at me.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.760
I know he still loves me.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.360
And he still worries for me always.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.400
Indeed, my lord.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.480
In all my life I have never seen

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.600
a brother love his younger
as Kosol loves Chaiyached.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.120
- Hey
- My lord

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.440
They hide here; I will not find them.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.800
Put down your sword.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.800
I want Chaiyached, and him only.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.200
If you go with us willingly,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.000
you will not need to fight.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.080
Put it down.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.680
My lord, flee at once.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.880
I will deal with him myself.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.520
No. I will never abandon you.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.000
Stay and fight with me.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.880
An Arabian dance.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.360
I arranged this specially for Your Majesty.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.600
Is she a beauty, my lady?

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.600
Hmm.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.120
I will have her serve close to Your Majesty.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.880
When you get close to Somdet,

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.560
find an opening to press
a dagger to his throat.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.080
Then Banjong and I, hidden,
will come out and finish him.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.200
Hey, she’s a kathoey!

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.760
Cut its head off.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.560
Everyone.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.160
Everyone, seize him now.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.400
Mob him.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.520
Somdet has fled.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.520
Surround him, hold him fast.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.680
Do not let him escape.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.320
Stop.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.440
You cannot rip my wig
and run off like that.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.200
Three things I hate most:

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.480
being defeated.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.520
Being deceived.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.320
And kathoey.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.080
All of which you embody.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.920
Die, you damned pervert.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.560
Prince.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.960
You’re awake?

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.360
Wait , am I dreaming?

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.600
You’re awake.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.200
Oh, I’m so glad.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.560
Nisa.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.760
What happened here?

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.200
Who is that, Nisa?

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.200
It’s Nat, your friend!

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.120
You don’t remember me?

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.880
- Nat?
- Yeah.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.920
Wait...

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.240
Did I come back
to the present day?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.520
Present day? What do you mean?

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.280
What? Huh?

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.440
You’ve been lying here like a veggie, girl.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.160
How are you feeling now?

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.800
Like I got hit in the head.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.440
But whatever.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.680
Hey, tell me what happened.
I’m so confused.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.800
Well, that day,

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.040
when you told me to get a guy
to entertain you,

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.880
there was this kid.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.440
Total homophobe.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.200
He poisoned your drink.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.880
And you’ve been out cold
ever since that day.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.880
Out cold?

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.200
How long was I out?

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.400
Seven days.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.560
Only seven days?

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.640
Why...

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.280
Where I went, it felt like
seven whole months.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.400
Seven months? What are you on about?

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.480
You didn’t go anywhere.
You were lying here,

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.000
like a total vegetable.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.400
Wait… oh, did you dream?

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.960
Was it a dream?

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.280
No, Nat.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.040
It felt so real.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.680
It was like I actually went,

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.800
I was living as Count Worradej.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.760
And I had a husband named Lord Kosol.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.400
Oh, stop it already.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.320
You’re totally delirious now.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.920
- Nat, I,
- Just lie down and rest.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.400
I’ll go get the doctor.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.760
Still, I’m just glad you woke up.
I’ll call the nurse.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Yes.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.320
Prince is awake now.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.560
Uh, could you call the doctor, please?

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.200
Okay, sure.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.560
The doctor will be here
to check on you soon.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.440
How are you feeling?

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.720
I’m just really happy
you woke up, honestly.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.760
How do you feel? Thirsty?
I’ll get you some water.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.080
Okay?

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.360
You’re awake.
I’m so glad.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.400
This kiss will remind you.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.400
That I will always be by your side.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.240
Wherever or whenever you may be.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.640
Kosol.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.440
Nat, Nat.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.920
- Nat
- What

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.760
I am not dreaming.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.120
I am not dreaming, Nat.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.520
What I said is true.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.720
I’m not dreaming.
I must go back.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.960
I must go back now.
I have to return to the past.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.560
Take me back, Nat.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.320
Take me back, Nat.
I’m not dreaming , please believe me.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.760
- I’m not dreaming, Nat
- What are you on about

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.320
- Nat
- Hey?

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.960
- Nat
- Doctor!

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.080
Please check on him.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.800
Something’s wrong with my friend.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.000
Doctor, I’m telling the truth.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.160
Doctor, please take me back to the past.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.120
I have to hurry back to help my friend.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.760
I must go help Banjong.
I must find Kosol.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.160
I must go defeat Somdet Saenyakorn.
Doctor, please.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.920
Doctor, please take me back.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.280
- Prince
- Doctor

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.760
I’m serious, Doctor. Please believe me.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.120
- You have to send me back, Doctor.
- Alright, calm down.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.560
- Nat, I mean it!
- Prince.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.120
- Prince.
- I’m telling the truth!

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.320
Listen to me first. It’s me, your doctor.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.520
Try to focus.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.240
Take a deep breath in.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.800
And exhale slowly.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.280
Follow my voice.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.920
Breathe in.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.920
Good, breathe in.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.639
Exhale. That’s it.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.480
Keep going. You’re doing great.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.880
- Prince.
- You’re alright.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.880
Prince! Prince!

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.080
Prince!

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.400
Wake up!

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.920
- Prince.
- Don’t fall asleep, Prince!

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.320
Prince, wake up!

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.159
Stay with us. Keep your eyes open!

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.040
Worradej...

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.159
Worradej, can you hear me?

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.360
Worradej...

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.719
Worradej.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.320
Can you hear me, Worradej?

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.960
Worradej, do you hear me?

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.400
Worradej...

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.600
Wake up, Worradej.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.000
You must wake up, Worradej!

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.080
Prince, open your eyes!

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.840
Open your eyes, Prince!

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.199
Prince, please, open your eyes!

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.639
Worradej...

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:54.920
Worradej!

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.200
Come back to me, Worradej.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.160
My life cannot go on without you, Worradej.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.320
Worradej...

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.080
You’ve come back to me!

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.920
Don’t ever leave me again.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.880
I’ve returned.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.280
You’re back.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.480
Banjong...

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.920
Take care of Worradej for me.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.480
I’ll go after Somdet.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.840
Kosol...

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.600
Be careful out there.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.360
Can you stand?

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.960
Easy now.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.080
Doctor, what’s wrong with my friend?

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.640
At this point, I can’t say for sure.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.560
But when a patient describes
events that never happened,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.080
it’s best we consult a psychiatrist.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.560
As for the poison Prince was exposed to,

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.240
I don’t think it could have caused

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.640
these kinds of psychological symptoms.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.080
So, are you saying,

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.840
my friend was telling the truth?

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.280
Here’s the thing.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.640
It could’ve been a dream,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.520
so vivid that it felt real,

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.600
to the point he can’t tell

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.120
what’s real and what’s not.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.520
Then...

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.480
will he ever be the same again?

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.240
He’s got so much work waiting,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.120
concerts, fan meets, and everything.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.680
Is there any chance he’ll recover?

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.280
I can’t give you a clear answer yet.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.160
We’ll have to wait until he wakes up again.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.840
Wake up, Prince. Come on!

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.360
- Open your eyes, Prince!
- Miss Nat, please!

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.280
- Miss Nat, that’s enough.
- Wake up, Prince!

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.080
You’ll only hurt him more.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.280
Doctor...

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.880
Is there any chance he will wake up?

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.560
Stop it now, you worm.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.640
Who are you calling a worm?

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.600
Act like you are in charge.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.280
Have you forgotten your own name?

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.320
You insolent wretch.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.760
You are getting far too arrogant.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.520
How dare you call me by my old name.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.400
Aren't you afraid your head will fall off?

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.080
That blunt stick in your hand.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.200
Cannot sever anyone's head.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.280
Right now.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.320
You have no soldiers.
Or nobles protecting you now.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.480
You are just a power-mad old man.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.480
I will smash that mouth of yours.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.560
Hey, hey.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.000
Hey, what is this?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.280
Hey.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.320
You have oppressed us for long enough.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.720
Today we take our revenge.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.880
How dare you?

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.320
- Ow.
- Is that enough to satisfy you, ma'am?

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.960
Here you are.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.440
- Well done, Im.
- What are you going to do, huh?

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.240
People like you deserve this.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.400
Ow, ow.
Wait, wait.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.400
Hold on.
Hold on.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.760
Up until now...

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.480
I have done many wrongs to you.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.160
Please forgive me.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.800
I beg your pardon.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.720
What if we do this.
What if we do this.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.120
If you join me,

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.400
become my allies,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.480
I will grant you rewards,
promotions, titles.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.280
Will you accept that, hmm?

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.480
It is too late now, ma'am.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.320
- Ow, ow.
- Mob.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.320
- Do not stop.
- Ow.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.160
- Keep hitting.
- Good.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.800
Well done, everyone.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.800
Ow, ow.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.320
- Good. Beat him to death.
- Ow.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.720
Ow.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.800
Funny, isn't it.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.520
When you were stabbed,

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.600
I was the one who dressed your wound.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.680
Now that I am struck on the head,

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.680
you come to dress my wound.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.080
So we call it even.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.480
But next time,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.720
let no one have to heal another again.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.720
Agreed.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.360
And then...

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.360
you were struck pretty hard.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.640
How do you feel now?

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.680
Still a little dizzy, I guess.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.760
But what scared me more

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.080
was when I passed out.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.520
I dreamed.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.200
A dream?

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.120
What did you dream of?

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.240
Was it that terrifying?

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.280
Well...

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.160
I dreamed that

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.000
I was in a place far, far away.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.480
And I would never see you all again.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.480
In that dream, I was terrified.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.400
I didn’t know what to do.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.040
Then suddenly, I woke up.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.880
Because Kosol kissed you.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.360
That’s why you woke up.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.280
Then...

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.280
if I faint again,

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.920
make sure Kosol kisses me again.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.160
Mmm.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.200
Let us hurry to the royal hall.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.840
I wonder if Kosol
has captured Somdet yet.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.960
Come on.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.200
Kosol.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.200
You did not capture Somdet?

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.960
I was not the one who caught him.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.520
Others helped to seize him.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.600
Oh!

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.360
Hmm, what a state.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.240
Has the poison worn off?

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.520
Then I...

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.000
will be the first to settle the score.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.200
Was it the one
who struck you with a stick?

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.520
No.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.080
It was the one who ripped off
my wig from my head.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.360
Mark my words.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.520
Next time,

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.360
never pull a transvestite’s wig off again.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.680
If you intend to kill me,

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.200
then do it quickly.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.000
Do not let this perverted person
demean me like this.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.800
I will not stand for it.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.160
Take his beard right off.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.120
We have already discussed this.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.680
We will spill as little blood as possible.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.120
Worradej begged me to spare his life.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.680
Imprison him instead.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.640
So perhaps one day he may repent.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.520
Then he may return to serve the state again.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.400
For he does possess certain talents.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.000
Me, approve of you lot?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.360
Grant freedom to serfs and slaves?

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.520
That would only breed chaos.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.920
Give rights and voice to the gullible,

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.200
and the realm will descend into ruin.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.520
Worse still,

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.120
to let those perverts

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.760
parade about like they own the place.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.520
I would rather die.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.960
What a monstrous old man.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.640
Such a foul mouth.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.320
All his logic is rotten.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.440
Good that he’s jailed.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.280
So we need not suffer for it.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.840
His warped mindset will no longer harm us.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.440
This is for the best.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.520
Others will be spared the trouble.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.040
For such corrupted thinking

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.240
is not admirable.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.400
Banjong.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.040
Take him and lock him up.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.280
Ched.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.480
Strain it carefully.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.800
Just a little more.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.320
Your desire to change the realm

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.400
will come to pass.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.200
You cannot leave Ched like this.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.080
Kosol, you must help Ched, Kosol.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.880
You must stand for election.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.480
Present your policies and campaign.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.920
Interested?

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.360
Are you certain we can win?

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.320
Somdet bribed the villagers

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.800
to vote for him.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.400
Somdet and the Count led men
to block the polling booths.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.240
Villagers couldn’t vote, sir.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.560
What?

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.880
A storm wasn’t enough,
(now there’s a whirlpool too?)

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.920
A whirlpool, really?

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.920
Help me!

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.160
(Soaked from every direction now!)

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.040
(This one’s right on the head!)

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.600
You think you’re that pretty?

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.720
Never thought I was pretty at all.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.360
That’s the right way to think.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.880
It’s obvious.
(It’s obvious who’s the prettiest!)

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.600
Hey, that’s a trans woman!

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.880
Pure Love, Brave Heart.
(The Trans Woman Who Never Yields.)
