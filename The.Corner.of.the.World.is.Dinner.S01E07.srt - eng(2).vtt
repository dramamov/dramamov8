Hello

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.400
This is Li Zhenggui's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.840
Art Livestream

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840
Welcome, welcome, welcome

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.599
New friends, feel free to follow

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.199
New friends, feel free to follow

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.120
And set up a fan sign

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.719
Let me say it again

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.759
This is an art livestream

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.080
Not your nightclub

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.080
I'm here to sell paintings

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.960
Not here to perform

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.680
Thank you

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.560
You're the ones acting all righteous

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.520
If you like it so much

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.080
black stockings and pole dancing

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.240
why not go dance yourselves

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.199
Start your own livestream

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.240
I'll come over

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.319
and send you gifts

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.039
How about that

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.000
How did I break any livestream rules

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.480
If people insult me

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.680
I can't talk back?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.800
Zhenggui

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.120
Show a little respect

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.399
for my hard work

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.319
I got up early

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.959
This was a lot of trouble

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.879
What's wrong with you

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.160
You've been down since yesterday

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:54.480
I'm going through

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.759
the biggest turning point of my life

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.759
What kind of turning point is that serious

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.720
I don't want to be an artist anymore

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:05.920
I want to live an ordinary life

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:06.920
Keep it simple

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.120
You

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.519
Except you don't have to work every day

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.879
How is your life not ordinary

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.680
Livestreaming is work too, okay

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.360
I just don't want to do it now

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.879
As an artist every day

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.199
I face online trolls

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.240
I really

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:32.759
suffer

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.000
Why not try a side job

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.560
to take your mind off things

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:41.680
Hui

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.480
Can you help me look

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.160
I

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.240
I want to try something new

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.839
The coffee shop downstairs from our office

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.759
is hiring a barista

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.519
Want me to ask for you

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.959
Am I going to be a barista

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:07.000
Miss

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.519
You haven't even started working

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.720
I'm heading to work now

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.680
Coffee

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.519
Done

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.079
Your coffee

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:42.720
Thank you

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.600
Take care

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.279
Welcome

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:46.439
Sit anywhere

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.720
Hello

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.839
Would you like to order anything

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.160
Zhang Hui referred me

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:03.920
You're Li Zhenggui

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.720
That's right

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:07.279
Do you know your interview

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.879
is two hours late

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.279
It's already ten o'clock

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.720
I've opened for business

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.279
Did you forget to set an alarm

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.480
Or did something hold you up

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.439
No, I never set alarms

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.600
I think waking up naturally

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.040
is better for my health

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.680
You just woke up

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.360
Can I try

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.600
your coffee while I'm here

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.639
To wake myself up

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.439
Ma'am

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.160
You know you're here for an interview, right

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.480
Of course

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.680
Did you know

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.040
Coffee beans

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.480
are actually coffee cherry seeds

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.639
And when ripe

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.199
they can be red or purple

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.120
But different varieties

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.839
can be yellow or orange too

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.560
A latte, please

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.720
Okay

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.720
Work hard

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:55.480
Got it

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.560
What's so special about that

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.160
It's natural

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.160
Here

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.839
Your latte

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:26.519
Thank you

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.879
Looks pretty good

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.240
Not bad

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.720
Give it a like

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:39.759
Sure

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.120
Why is my coffee different from theirs

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.039
Are you discriminating against customers

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:47.159
Sir

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.120
No, no, no

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.200
You ordered an Americano

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.720
He ordered a latte

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.720
Lattes come with latte art

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:55.600
Latte art is an art form

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.279
Art is unique

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:58.440
So it's not about you

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.360
Why not try a latte yourself

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:03.159
I want exactly what he has

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.440
Alright

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.360
Why do I feel like you're here to perform

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:14.720
Perform

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:27.159
Hui

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:28.360
You don't look well

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.279
Are you okay

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.120
I don't know what's wrong lately

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.320
I'm sleepy all day and night

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.360
Maybe I'm getting old

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.519
Can't stay up late anymore

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.720
I was just about to find you

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.960
These are the new resumes

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.720
I've screened them

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.279
Take a look

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.519
See if any fit your department

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.519
Alright, thanks

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:43.159
Okay

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.200
Nian

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.240
I'm working overtime again today

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.559
Can't go grocery shopping

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.519
That's just how it is

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.879
I'll message her on WeChat

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:12.039
Just mentioning her annoys me

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.279
The coffee shop manager just called me

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.279
Said Li Zhenggui was fired

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:24.200
That's just her personality

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.159
Nothing you can do

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.240
Okay

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.559
Hui

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:43.519
Coming, coming

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.919
Come again

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.519
Take care on your way.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.799
Zhenggui

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:03.440
You came to buy groceries today.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.519
That's right.

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:06.159
The other two don't have time today.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.559
It's fine.

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:08.919
I remember before,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.240
they never let you buy groceries.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:11.919
That was before.

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:12.720
Now, without me,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.960
they'd go hungry.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:20.120
Can you stop staring at them like that?

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:20.960
The way you stare

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.639
makes me feel uneasy.

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:24.840
Uncle

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:26.919
Did you forget what I do?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.600
I'm an artist.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.120
So I'm admiring

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.919
nature's creations.

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:33.840
Beautiful.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.519
No matter how beautiful,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.720
won't it end up in your stomach tonight?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.320
It's not the same.

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:43.279
There's brilliance in that moment of life.

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:45.519
Sixty-one jin.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.279
Boss

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.679
Don't worry.

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:04.960
With me here,

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.080
not a single cat

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.480
can get near these shrimp.

00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:12.840
Zhenggui

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.679
How about you watch the stall for me?

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:16.919
No problem, no problem.

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:18.879
But, Uncle,

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.399
what I really want to say is

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:22.240
the freshness of these shrimp

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.279
decreases over time.

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:27.759
So most people

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:31.360
wait until the market is about to close

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.279
to sell at a lower price.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:36.519
But I'm not taking advantage.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.559
I just think it's fair

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.840
six thirty.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720
At six thirty,

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:44.720
if these shrimp aren't sold,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.080
sell them to me for half price.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.919
Thirty.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.799
Deal.

00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:55.919
Wait, you said

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:56.879
no backing out.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.039
Put the gun away.

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.480
Carrying this is really tiring.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.759
I wonder why my art journey

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.159
is so full of obstacles.

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:19.559
Living in a place with these red and green fabrics,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.080
how can I become a master?

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:23.279
Zhenggui

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.639
It's really tough for you.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.720
I'm back.

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.519
Look how much I brought.

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.639
So many shrimp!

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:45.559
How much did it cost?

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:46.720
Didn't go over budget.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.519
You're making us a feast today.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.399
Of course.

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:51.879
I'll put them in the kitchen first.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.720
What are you doing?

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:17.240
I think our neighborhood committee

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:19.279
has poor taste.

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:20.639
When I came back,

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:21.919
I saw those cloth strips

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.440
and almost cried.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.879
Of course.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.759
Our Li Zhenggui is a true artist.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.840
Our ordinary stuff

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.519
could never impress you.

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:35.559
What do you mean?

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:37.519
Did I offend you?

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:43.519
How's the coffee shop job

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.080
going today?

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.440
Pretty good.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.080
I think the manager is nice.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.919
But

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.360
all the customers today

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.759
were amazed by my latte art.

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:01.840
Totally impressed.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.279
They even wanted to tip me.

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:04.679
Who am I?

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.080
I'm Li Zhenggui.

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:07.679
I never accept tips.

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:10.159
I just want my art to be appreciated.

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:17.720
Who is it?

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:22.360
You're home?

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.000
Yu Dama

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.679
May I come in?

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:24.480
Sure, sure.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.440
Please change your shoes.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.039
Change shoes.

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:35.759
Your house

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:37.440
has the same layout as mine.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.360
It's beautiful.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720
Solid wood.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.519
Writing desk.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.440
Looks like an antique.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.720
Chopping table.

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:50.440
Chopping table, huh?

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.320
I know this one.

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:55.519
We use this to feed our cat at home.

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:56.480
Cat bell.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.519
Cat bell.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.039
Timer, Dama.

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:00.320
Timer.

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:02.080
So creative!

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:05.559
Your house is really nice.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.519
It feels so cozy.

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:10.360
Your house

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.080
has the same layout as ours,

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080
but there's something

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.720
it looks truly grand.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.000
So beautiful.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.080
Dama, why don't you have a seat?

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:21.759
This sofa

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:22.720
is so soft.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.320
Yu Dama, you're here.

00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:29.039
All three of you are here.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.080
I was just passing by.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.919
Came to take a look.

00:16:31.039 --> 00:16:31.600
Alright.

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.320
Yu Dama

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:38.840
You're not here to

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.639
put up those cloth strips

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:42.240
in our house, are you?

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.440
Actually,

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:46.720
I came to talk about that.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.519
No, please don't.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:49.440
Because I think

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.240
Zhenggui

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:52.159
Let Dama finish what she's saying.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.480
Here's the situation.

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.720
The higher-ups assigned our community

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.759
an important task.

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:04.160
They want our neighborhood committee

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.279
to promote Jiangzhou's tourist spots.

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:10.359
Everyone

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.200
has been searching for a skilled artist.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.480
We hope for long-term help

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.079
with designing posters and banners.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.920
So our street

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.279
looks more refined and cultured.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.680
And more beautiful.

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:27.119
So you're saying

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:30.039
you want a professional

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:32.119
to design these long-term?

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.720
That's right.

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:36.680
You're one of the talents we have in mind.

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:38.119
Me? I...

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:39.519
Are you joking?

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:41.720
How could I joke about this?

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:44.559
We've visited your art livestream.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.519
We all admire your work.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.000
Everyone gave you high praise.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.680
We think you're truly talented.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.640
And you have youthful energy.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.720
Plus, you're creative.

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:54.920
Li Zhenggui,

00:17:55.079 --> 00:17:56.000
finally someone

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.680
truly appreciates your art.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.359
So my talent

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:02.200
isn't just for the livestream.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.519
It can help others too.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.400
Alright then.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.079
It's settled.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.240
Take care, Yu Dama.

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:10.000
Oh, right—

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.920
There's one more thing.

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:13.160
Today is Safety Awareness Day.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.039
This is an old building.

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:16.640
Since I'm here,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.960
let me check your kitchen.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.799
Take a look at the gas and such.

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.480
Check the safety measures.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.000
Please.

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:34.160
It's very clean in here.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.279
The gas stove is well maintained.

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:39.039
But don't get complacent.

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:41.160
You must keep safety a top priority.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.920
No carelessness allowed.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.680
Yu Dama,

00:18:45.319 --> 00:18:46.119
wait a moment.

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:51.519
Please take this.

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:52.519
We bought too much.

00:18:52.519 --> 00:18:53.680
Help us use some up.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.839
No, no, that's not right.

00:18:54.839 --> 00:18:55.720
Why not?

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.079
These shrimp are delicious.

00:18:57.079 --> 00:18:58.920
If we wait till tomorrow, they'll spoil.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.720
Alright then.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:00.960
I'll take these shrimp

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.519
to the senior care kitchen.

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:04.920
I'll thank you on their behalf.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.079
No need to thank me.

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:08.799
I just asked you to help Li Zhenggui find a job this afternoon.

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:10.079
And you found one by tonight.

00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:11.519
I should be thanking you.

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:12.559
Did I play my part well?

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:13.519
Did I give myself away?

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.200
All good.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.160
Your place is really clean.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.359
You keep it spotless.

00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:19.440
Hope you keep up

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.079
this spotless spirit.

00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:21.920
No need to see me out.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.279
I'm taking the shrimp now.

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:25.079
Take care, Yu Dama.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.640
I guarded those shrimp all day,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.680
how could you just give them away?

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:36.920
Sorry!

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.480
Just think of it as

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.519
a contribution to the senior care kitchen.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.839
Don't be mad.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.839
So what are we eating tonight?

00:19:43.839 --> 00:19:45.680
To celebrate your new job,

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.359
we're having a feast tonight.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.000
Burgundy Beef Stew.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.839
That'll do.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.119
Red wine beef stew

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.000
originated in Burgundy, France.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:13.880
There,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.799
they're famous for Pinot Noir red wine.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.440
Legend has it

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.960
Burgundy farmers

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.240
after a hard day's work

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.440
would buy cheaper,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.440
tougher cuts of beef

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.359
that are harder to cook.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.480
They'd slow-cook them in local red wine

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:34.559
until the beef turned tender.

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:38.359
The wine gives the beef a unique flavor.

00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:41.039
Snow falls outside,

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.880
while the family gathers inside,

00:20:44.319 --> 00:20:48.559
enjoying a rich, comforting dinner.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.240
They'd add root vegetables

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.839
to soak up the hearty gravy.

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:33.599
Over time,

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.200
this affordable, tasty dish

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.680
became popular across France.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.440
But what made it loved worldwide

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.319
was an American TV chef—

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:24.319
Julia Child.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.640
I first learned about it

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.839
from my favorite actress

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:34.559
Meryl Streep's biopic

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.559
Julie & Julia.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.880
Julie, an office worker,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.920
struggles with a fast-paced, unrewarding job.

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:44.640
Her kitchen becomes her only escape.

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.839
With her husband's support,

00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:49.039
she decides to spend a year

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:53.039
cooking every recipe from Julia's book.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.920
She starts a blog

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.960
to document her daily progress.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.279
She hopes that through cooking

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.519
she'll find her true self

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.160
and rediscover her love for life.

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:09.039
There's a line in the film

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.799
that's cheesy but heartfelt:

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.200
You are the butter to my bread,

00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:19.079
you are the breath of my life.

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:23.240
You're the butter on my bread,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.720
the breath in my life.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:36.880
It smells amazing.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.720
I'm going crazy.

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:40.920
This wine must be expensive.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.680
Dinner isn't over budget again, is it?

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.599
The wine is Li Zhenggui's private stash.

00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:45.599
So it's not over budget.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.680
Alright.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.880
Then tonight,

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.000
since you used my wine

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.200
as your cooking wine,

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:57.640
I'll eat a little more.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.640
No matter what happened today,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.720
when night comes,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.599
we deserve the best dinner.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.759
Cheers to dinner.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.240
Cheers to Li Zhenggui's new job.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:15.960
Let's eat!

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.240
I want to eat rice.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.200
Pumpkin counts as a staple.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.039
I want rice.

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.119
Then I want a bowl too.

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:12.839
So our barista—

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.319
Was work smooth today?

00:28:17.599 --> 00:28:18.599
It went well.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.559
But I think...

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.200
The community committee needs me now.

00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:26.119
I think I should

00:28:26.119 --> 00:28:28.400
use all my talent and skills

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:29.640
to serve others.

00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:33.920
Should I go to the café tomorrow

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.599
and help you quit your job?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.799
No need.

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:40.039
I can handle small things myself.

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:41.160
No trouble.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.799
Can't be helped.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.200
What can I say? Everyone loves me, right?

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.160
So talented.

00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:49.559
Zhenggui.

00:28:49.839 --> 00:28:51.319
Actually, whatever we do,

00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:53.240
we have to rely on our own effort.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.359
Don't forget—

00:28:54.839 --> 00:28:56.160
financial independence.

00:28:57.279 --> 00:28:58.079
Got it.

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.440
We all know you're capable.

00:29:00.519 --> 00:29:01.960
So with this new job,

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.640
you'll give it your all.

00:29:05.319 --> 00:29:06.119
Definitely.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.960
Hello, everyone.

00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:31.640
Friends in the Art Livestream,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960
it's Little Zhenggui.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.839
Any fans out there?

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:46.240
If there are fans,

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.000
remember to send some gifts.

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:55.200
Alright.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.519
So today I want to

00:29:57.519 --> 00:29:59.519
officially announce to everyone

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.200
this is my last livestream.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.359
Thank you all for your support.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.440
I'll miss you.

00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:09.880
Bye-bye.
