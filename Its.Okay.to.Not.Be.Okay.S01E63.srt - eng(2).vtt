WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.253
"Nakita Mo Ba Ang Mukha Ko?"

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.337
-After that--
-After that--

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:05.422
Matmat…

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.549
Matmat's not done reading yet.

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:10.218
We're family, right?

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:12.429
And family loves each other.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.055
I love Mia.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.058
Matmat loves his family.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.685
You're my family too, Matmat.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.937
He was my first and only love.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.940
But Ingrid and
Samuel's marriage was arranged.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.526
Why didn't you tell Mia
about your connection?

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.862
Because Ingrid will come back.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.655
This is her writing style.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.365
Eden is my mother.

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.885
That's so easy to do now.

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:36.930
She's doing that for her own advantage.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:38.681
Just to get what she wants.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:42.977
That's why she wanted
Mister Samuel under her care.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.730
Because she wanted Papa under her control.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.273
That's why she came back…

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.318
to do the same thing to me.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.031
I'll call Vincent.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.158
-So he can alert the police.
-Mia.

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.288
I read in the book "Dalagita."

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.083
It said,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.129
"A worthless child
should be thrown into the sea."

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.508
That's a threat, Mia.

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.511
That's why I want you to think

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.471
of what she'll do if she gets near you.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.978
I won't let her ruin the life I have now.

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.242
Long time,

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.119
Dipong.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.292
Wasn't the value of
the ring I gave you enough?

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.089
So you sided with someone else.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.719
Surprise.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:48.478
You?

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.356
You're Ma'am Ingrid?

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.865
You're still beautiful.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.499
And you're still obsessed with me.

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:29.519
There's nothing I hate more than

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.563
a traitor.

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:16.858
And now…

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.694
the last one I'll go after.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:39.672
Eden?

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.889
What are you doing here?

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.226
He's no longer in the hospital,

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.312
and you're still visiting him?

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.817
You've gone that far,

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:01.652
Olivia?

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.280
Eden…

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.824
Just so you can be

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.077
with my,

00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:11.496
…husband.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:15.500
Ingrid?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.303
He never even mention your name.

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.973
That's how badly he wanted to forget you.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:36.437
I knew he was in love with someone
else when he studied in New York,

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.148
but I thought to myself,

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.026
why would I even bother?

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.113
It was an arranged marriage anyway.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.282
You know what I can't forgive?

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.786
From the moment
you set foot in OK Hospital,

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:54.580
you made me look like a fool!

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.178
What if you don't go to the interview?

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.931
We can't just stop living
our lives just because of her.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.809
Anyway, the police are looking for her.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.313
Okay, fine. But be vigilant, okay?

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:04.150
After the meetings,
we'll head home straight away.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.862
We'll be home by
the time your shift ends.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.035
Matmat, let's go.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.413
Good luck with your meeting, Matmat.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.957
It's okay to be nervous.
Just don't be shy.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.419
Mia will help you.

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:25.505
Matmat,

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.548
I got you.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:34.889
Matmat will
do his best at the meeting,

00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.682
and with the interview.

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:38.851
Okay, Matmat.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.311
Happy day.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.774
-H-H-Happy day!
-Happy day.

00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:47.276
Let's go.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.578
Madeth, was the interviewer
briefed on Matmat's condition?

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.872
Yes, Boss V.
She's actually excited to meet him.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.542
Okay. Good. Mia doesn't
want Matmat to be uncomfortable.

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.502
Yes, Boss V. I prepared for that.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.713
Okay, it needs to be smooth.
This is the first interview

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.214
of Mia in such a long time.

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.049
And everything should be perfect.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.468
Boss V, I got this.
Okay? Everything's prepared.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.304
Impressive! You got everything covered!

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:59.432
That's why I think you deserve this.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:01.892
Boss V, what's this?

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.693
Boss V, we have money now!

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:11.986
That's from Erica's investment.

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:14.363
Of course,
I should be investing in people too.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:18.034
So that's your salary for
the past months, plus a bonus.

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.703
Oh gosh, Boss V!

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:24.957
I can't believe you do have
a heart somewhere down there!

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.002
I think Gemma's really
been good for you.

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:31.922
Of course,
we have to give as much as we're getting.

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:36.510
That's what you get for
your good work and honesty.

00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:38.554
Come on. Let's go.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.891
Boss V…

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.184
What?

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:44.393
Let's go.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.563
Uh,

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.148
Boss V.

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.942
Speaking of honesty,

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.152
very honest.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.696
What's this?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.701
Madeth!

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.703
You've had this all along?!

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.123
You made me go through the bins,
I was swimming through trash,

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.249
and you had it all along?!

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.086
Boss V, you just said,

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:12.755
"We have to give as
much as we're getting."

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.052
Okay. Good job.

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:20.221
Thank you for safekeeping this, but,

00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:22.390
don't ever do this again, okay?

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.225
Y-Yes, Boss V. Sorry!

00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:25.810
Okay. Very good. Let's go.

00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:26.852
Yes, Boss V.

00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:30.272
Mia, many have been waiting

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:34.318
for your new book,
"Have You Seen My Face?"

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.904
Mia, you've written many books.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.449
What makes this one special?

00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:47.289
This one is special to me because…

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.126
when I was writing this book,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.796
I was surrounded by
people who mean a lot to me.

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.757
And for the first time I,

00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:00.553
collaborated very
closely with the illustrator.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:02.930
I see.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:06.892
Matmat, is this
your first time working with Mia?

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:22.783
Matmat?

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:25.828
You got this.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:39.633
It's Matmat's f-first
time working with M-Mia.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:46.432
It's Matmat's first time
working as an illustrator.

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:47.850
That's right.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:52.605
And for a first-timer,
Matmat, you drew wonderfully.

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:05.201
So, Miss Mia Hernandez…

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.495
When are you going
to release the new book?

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.247
What a comeback.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.834
Let me out!

00:13:55.918 --> 00:14:00.548
-I need to see my daughter!
-Ingrid, I'm doing this all for you.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.384
You need to be well!

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.512
How are you going to report your husband

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:08.514
if you're mind's not well, huh?!

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.808
I'm not crazy!

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:12.977
There's nothing wrong with me!

00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:15.896
And I don't plan on
using the law against him!

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.441
I'm going to kill him!
I'm going to kill my husband!

00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:23.153
Let me out!

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:28.242
Let me out!

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:32.246
Let me out! I'm going to kill my husband!

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:34.498
Let me out!

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.292
Let's go over here, Vio.

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.502
Let's go play.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:42.339
Come here, come here.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:47.845
Hello, Doc?

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:51.223
That patient I was telling you about…

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.602
She's becoming more violent.

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:59.815
I'm afraid because
she's becoming a threat.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.191
Even to herself.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.820
Should I administer
a higher dose of anti-psychotics?

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.366
Okay, Doc.

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:12.453
I will do that right away.

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.879
Please have something to eat.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.509
What's your name?

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.012
It's Vio. My name is Vio.

00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:43.943
How's your writing going?

00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:50.115
You know…

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.493
You are doing very good.

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.705
It took you a few
years to recover, but…

00:15:58.248 --> 00:15:59.249
We're here.

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:02.753
Just a little while longer,

00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:05.714
and you'll finally be free.

00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:09.259
You'll be able to see your daughter.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.439
You'll finally get justice
for what Samuel did to you.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:26.110
I've been
telling you for a long time…

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.862
There's nothing wrong with me.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.157
I should've been free a long time ago.

00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:47.965
Help. Help.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:33.594
And the witch
watches as her beloved passes.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:40.601
As he jousts with death,
the witch smiles with joy.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.160
A smile as wide as the sky.

00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:03.165
She has finally done
what she planned to do

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.084
all these years she's been quiet.

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:16.678
Doc Emman? Doc Emman, code blue!

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:17.846
Code blue!

00:19:17.614 --> 00:19:18.699
And so,

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:22.828
the witch has finally returned

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.747
to reclaim the child

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.959
shaped from the
very essence of her being.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.961
A woman
was found dead at a cemetery

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:16.173
in the town of
Maravida on Thursday morning.

00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:19.468
Authorities have
identified the victim as Olivia Jose,

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.677
a woman in her late 50s.

00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:21.762
Patrick.

00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:22.971
-Doc?
-Patrick…

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:25.098
It's Ma'am Olivia.

00:20:26.141 --> 00:20:28.268
They found her dead at the cemetery.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:29.978
What?

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:32.147
Her body was waiting for them.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.941
But no suspect has been named yet.

00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:35.776
…Investigators are continuing
to determine whether the cause

00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:38.570
-of her death was of foul play…
-Patrick!

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:40.656
…or natural causes.

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:46.495
Hello, Vincent.
Matmat is outside the house.

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:49.831
I just got through the gate.
Matmat is here.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.500
Okay! You're safe and sound.

00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:53.961
Thank goodness.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:58.423
I sent a few men to fetch you.
No need to wait around for Mia.

00:20:58.507 --> 00:20:59.925
O-Okay.

00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:01.718
Matmat will stay here.

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:04.388
I'll be waiting in the room.

00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:06.431
Alright, that's good. Just call me

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.475
or the security if
you need anything. Okay?

00:21:08.558 --> 00:21:10.227
Okay, Vincent.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.436
Bye-bye.

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.945
-Miss, I'd like to order.
-Of course.

00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:20.988
Can I have the menu, please?

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:44.011
I don't see any security around.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:11.371
-Just the burger, please.
-Burger only.

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:12.789
-Make it delicious.
-Sure thing.

00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.041
-The best burger.
-Alright.

00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:15.250
-Very good.
-Thank you.

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.543
Thank you.

00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:19.880
Patrick?

00:22:19.963 --> 00:22:22.591
Why didn't you pick up sooner?
Get Mia out of here!

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.634
Huh? Wait, what happened to Mia?

00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:25.719
Mia's in danger.

00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.471
-Ma'am Olivia was murdered.
-What?!

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:30.348
I'm sure Ma'am Eden was behind it.

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.851
The police are already looking for her.
I took care of it already--

00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:34.978
Just do as I say. Get her away from here!

00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:37.898
Take her to Manila or some province--
She needs to be safe!

00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:39.524
Okay. Okay.

00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:42.402
Okay, I'll take care of Mia.
You can count on me.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.280
Patrick! Matmat's alone in the mansion!

00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:49.034
Alright, I'll call security
and go pick him up.

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:09.513
N-No one is here. It's empty.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.229
Matmat promised to wait in the room.

00:23:58.353 --> 00:24:00.021
Hello, Matmat.

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.409
You want to see him?

00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:14.244
I will be here waiting for you.

00:24:14.327 --> 00:24:16.329
You'll answer
for everything you did.

00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:17.622
I said that was not me.

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:19.666
Patrick asked me
to take you away from here!

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:23.545
If anything happens to Patrick and Matmat,
you and I are over!

00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:24.629
Mia!

00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:27.340
The both of you are
ruining my daughter's life!

00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:29.551
All we've ever done is love Mia!

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.011
Who said you could do that?!

00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:32.095
What else do you want?

00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:33.763
-Die!
-Patrick!
