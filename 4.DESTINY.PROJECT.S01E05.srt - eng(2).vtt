David.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.110
Please remind the finance team

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.450
to analyze each stock more thoroughly.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.640
And resubmit it to me.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.740
Certainly.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.980
I will remind them.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.610
Are you taking the day off tomorrow?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.340
Please update my schedule for tomorrow.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.430
You have an appointment to sign a contract with Mr. Phawat tomorrow

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.700
at a restaurant near the Atmoz Palacio Ladprao-Wanghin at 4 p.m.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.750
Will you be leaving now?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.580
There is a new restaurant opening in this building.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.060
Would you like me to make a reservation for you?

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.670
You haven't eaten anything today.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.410
I'm not very hungry.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.650
Thank you.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.530
You will get a stomachache

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.510
if you don't eat anything.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.950
This is the MOU.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.030
Please read it, Mr. Phawat.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.530
Thank you.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.830
Thank you for investing with us, Mr. Haran.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.610
This development is beautifully designed.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.950
I am honored to do business with you.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.710
I'll let you know immediately if there's any progress.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.400
♫ It must be because we are tired and exhausted ♫

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.730
What happened?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.120
Nothing.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.000
Our development aims to enhance both comfort and safety.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.660
Don't worry about it, Mr. Haran.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.850
I hope you won't cause me any concern either, Mr. Phawat.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.200
And I hope it's worth my investment with you.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.260
Yes.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.210
If our development makes progress,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.450
may I invite you again, Mr. Haran?

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.220
My pleasure.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.230
I'll excuse myself for a moment.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.710
Oh, yes. Sure.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.800
I wish you all a wonderful day today.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.190
You.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.530
Get off me.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.590
You're doing well,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.150
right?

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.540
Excuse me.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.520
I don't know you.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.090
I think you should let go of my hand

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.430
before I call the manager.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.900
Thank you all so much.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.690
See you next time.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.550
Un, how are you getting home today?

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.480
I'll probably take a taxi like every day.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.130
It's raining heavily outside.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.700
It's probably difficult to hail a taxi today, Un.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.210
Really?

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.980
I'll try requesting first.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.510
Okay.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.390
I'm praying you can get one.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:42.900
- Thank you.
- Bye bye.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:43.580
See you.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.240
Yeah.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.420
- Un.
- Un!

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.460
Great.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.730
You're still here.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.000
Oh, Pete.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.560
I'll take you home.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.830
It might be a while if you call a taxi.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.940
There's a traffic jam right now.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.430
That really helps a lot.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.710
Thank you, Un.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.190
You sang for my restaurant again.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.910
Without you,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.410
I would be in trouble.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.040
It's just a little thing

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.100
It's not a big deal.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.610
Don't worry.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.550
Are you hungry?

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.370
Would you like something to eat?

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.670
Or head home?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.350
I'd better head home now.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.950
Let's go.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.390
How was your singing today?

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.430
Pretty good.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.380
Did you know the restaurant is packed because of you?

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.930
You're exaggerating again.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.240

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.370
Oh, Heart.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.070
Did you wait long?

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:40.650
Not at all.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.950
Wanna head home now?

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.230
Yeah.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.430
Okay.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.670
Thanks.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.040
Let's go.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.540
Watch the door.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.430
Heart!

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.370
I've brought your energy.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.410
How's your day going?

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:38.830
Good.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.010
How about you? Are you tired?

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.050
Not at all.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.340
I feel refreshed the moment I see you.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.950
Same here.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.890
Heart, kiss my cheek too.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:52.840
Sure.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.540
So cute.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.530
Happy.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.010
I'll wait for you outside.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:10.990
Okay.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.050
Let's break up.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.230
Un.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.280
I'm sorry, Un.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.680
Please listen to me, Un.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:32.820
Un.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:35.940
Un!

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.830
You only work. You never call me.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.210
Have you eaten anything, son?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.480
Yes.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.110
I have eaten.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.140
Are you okay?

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.610
Or is there a problem with your work?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.210
Do you want me to tell your dad?

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.520
It's not.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.320
I'm just a little drunk.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.470
I'm going to hang up now, Mom.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.390
Are you missing Un, son?

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:54.890
Yes.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.410
It's been a long time, Heart.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.750
You need to move on from the past.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.080
I can't do it, Mom.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.080
In the past,

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.280
I thought it would be good

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.800
if Un found someone better than me.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.610
But in the end, it was me who...

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.350
who didn't want to lose Un to anyone.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.810
Yes, it's cool.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.230
By the way...

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.510
do you know Mr. Haran too?

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.730
Who is he?

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.270
I don't know him.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.430
He is a very hot young investor right now.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.690
All the businesses he invested in prospered.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.890
He's really good.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.590
The waiter at the restaurant said he's been coming to hear you sing lately,

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.770
so I thought you might know him.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.240
I was thinking of asking you to help me take a selfie with him.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.220
Oh, really?

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.410
I don't know him.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:56.620
By the way...

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.920
did you go a bit off-key in the last song?

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.470
No way.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.580
Which part?

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.590
I've been singing this song for years.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.910
How can I sing it off-key?

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.920
It's you who's got bad ears.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.520
Just search 'new ear near me'.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.340
I guess I really need to search 'new ear near me'.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.250
Let's go.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:31.689
I can walk the rest.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.570
It's late.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.190
Fine.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.980
Drive safely.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:43.550
See you.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.770
Bye.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:19.020
This company's ideas might be more forward-thinking
and modern than those of the long-established OG Group,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:24.200
but being a rapidly growing new company also makes the board hesitant.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.230
I will reconsider these two companies.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.450
I will email you a summary of the meeting.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.650
Please check my schedule

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.710
and arrange another meeting with the chairpersons
of the two companies for further discussions.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.110
Yes. Mr. Haran.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.010
What about Pete I asked you to investigate?

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:54.980
Yes.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.170
I got a little bit of information about him.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.200
He is the owner of the restaurant where Un works.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.160
He is 25 years old, the same age as Un.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.050
I heard that they were close two years ago when they were studying abroad.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.530
I heard from the waiter that the singer's schedule at the restaurant is not matching up.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.710
So Un became a special singer at the restaurant there.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.170
What about my class?

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:16.870
Oh.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.810
This is your class schedule.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.680
It starts this Sunday.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.120
Thank you.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.370
Please continue handling the documents on this desk.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.850
I will attend the next meeting myself.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.440
You barely have time to rest.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.250
Are you still going to take extra classes?

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.060
Sorry for making you wait. The previous class...

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.870
Hello.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.110
Don't tell me that the student is...

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:15.820
It's me.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.320
Why did you do this?

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.020
Me?

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:26.610
What did I do?

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.360
Didn't I tell you to live separately?

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.170
And pretend we don't know each other if we happen to meet.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.650
Are you trying to tease me on purpose?

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.500
Wait, Un.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.370
I...

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.210
I didn't mean to annoy you.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:55.310
I...

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.490
I miss you.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.050
Just go back. I won't teach you.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.770
Would a famous academy like this

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.800
really reject students?

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.850
I really want to learn it.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.240
I'm not forcing you.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.890
I will let someone else teach you.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.610
Hello, Teacher Un.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:27.770
We will practice pronunciation so that we can speak with confidence.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.150
Pronounce clearly.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.300
And control your tone well.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.130
Let's start with a warm-up.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.150
Because good pronunciation starts with steady breathing.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:39.980
Please follow me.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.720
Put your hands on your stomach.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.390
Breathe in slowly for 4 seconds.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.090
Let your stomach expand.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.700
Hold for 2 seconds.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.090
Exhale slowly for 6 seconds.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.370
Stomach flat.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:02.170
Repeat 3-5 times.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.350
Please follow me.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.610
Mr. Heart?

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:16.420
Yes.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.710
Please concentrate before starting the lesson.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.270
Take a slow breath... Close your eyes!

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.400
Take it slow.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.020
Hold for 2 seconds.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.830
Exhale slowly for 6 seconds.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:31.850
Stomach flat.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.170
Un.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.030
Pete.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.220
Have you been here long?

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.290
I just arrived.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.390
Oh. Hello, Mr. Haran.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:50.800
Hello.

00:25:50.801 --> 00:25:51.870
I'm...

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.260
Pete. Un's friend.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.670
We meet again.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.740
Yes.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:59.930
Let's go. I'm hungry.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.380
Let's go.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.360
Are you guys going to get something to eat?

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.470
Can I join you?

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:06.960
I'm hungry too.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.010
Umm...

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.940
That's fine.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.640
Then let's hurry and go.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.550
Teacher Un is very hungry.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.390
I heard you are investing in a new real estate company.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.970
You must be very busy these days, right?

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.010
Yes.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:52.960
Quite busy.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.080
Even though you are busy, you still find time to study with Teacher Un.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.270
You are really diligent.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.130
I am the type of person

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.870
who makes time for things that interest me.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.150
Is that so?

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:19.060
I never thought you would be interested in it.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.680
The steak has been served.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:46.690
Would you like to eat it first, Un?

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.540
Or would you rather wait for pasta?

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.020
I'd rather wait for pasta.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.290
Pasta is here, Un.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.240
Let's eat.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.050
Please help yourself.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.990
Let me get this for you.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:27.100
Be careful not to stain your shirt.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.840
Oh, it looks so delicious.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.380
The food here is the best.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.810
Would you like to order something else?

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.810
We can order it later.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:58.330
Wait!

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.340
Aren't you allergic to wheat flour?

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.360
You're right.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.010
I forgot about it.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.770
Excuse me, could I get a new plate, please?

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.290
Would you like to order anything else?

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.890
I'll tell my waiter.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.290
That's okay.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.350
I rarely eat at restaurants

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.070
So I forgot about it.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:36.060
Okay.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.750
This pasta is my favorite.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.090
You always order it when you come here.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.250
Your pasta

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:55.840
is the most delicious.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:00.170
Do you like pasta?

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.690
Why didn't I know this...?

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.150
Yes.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.760
I like it.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:12.740
Which dish would you like to eat, Un?

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.150
Steak or salad?

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.780
I'll eat it later.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.790
Salad is also good.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.900
Would you like to get more?

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.560
I will order it for you.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:31.540
Let's finish this one first.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.270
Let's continue eating.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.520
I'd better head off.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.730
I've got something I need to attend to.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.870
As for this meal, it's on me.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.420
Wait a minute, Mr. Haran!

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.180
You don't have to pay for this meal.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:03.060
I was planning on bringing Un to have dinner with me today anyway.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.570
Most importantly,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.800
this is my restaurant.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.640
Also, the waiter said that you have been coming here often recently.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.750
It's an honor for my restaurant.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.860
But I disturb you this meal.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:21.970
I'm more comfortable paying for it myself.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.260
I don't know

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.380
what the relationship is between you and Un.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.710
But I can feel every time

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.060
that Un is really uncomfortable around you.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:37.030
If you can, I'd prefer that you stay away from him.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.350
Do you love Un?

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:47.460
Yes.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.070
I love Un.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.930
And I won't lose Un to anyone.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.340
I can't accept what you ask for.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:00.960
Un and I

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.230
used to love each other.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.750
I'll do whatever it takes to get Un back.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.800
Sorry I'm late.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.170
My meeting ended late.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.650
Yes.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.670
You can call me if you are unable to attend class next time.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:04.290
But you...

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.550
blocked my number.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.370
I mean, call the academy.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.380
Let's get started so we don't waste time.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.200
Next, let's read some business speech.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:37.460
Like mission statements or quotes from famous CEOs.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.330
To observe our pacing and voice.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.510
Let's start with the first speech.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.330
Doing important business requires passion.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.420
Even if the economy is bad, our business can still grow.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.920
Next.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.920
A key thing to remember when launching a business is that

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.910
it should have the power to change the world.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.390
I think if you get bored

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.910
or don't want to study anymore,

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.220
you can cancel this course.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:19.100
No, Un.

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:20.130
Not at all.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:24.400
But you don't seem to be paying attention to what I'm teaching.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.530
I'm sorry.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.730
I never get tired of you.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.660
We only meet once a week.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.090
You know it's not enough for me.

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:42.030
There are a lot of things on my mind these days.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.090
If it's work-related, you should handle it properly.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.520
Study when you are ready.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.890
It's not a work matter.

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:57.900
It's about you.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.540
Especially when that guy said he had feelings for you,

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.330
it made me even more irritated.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:10.670
What are you talking about?

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.440
I'm jealous of you.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.470
I don't want you to be close to anyone.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.890
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:28.390
Please come back to me, Un.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:29.960
Hands off!

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.110
We broke up a long time ago.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.600
Please stop acting like this.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.640
It's my right to be close to anyone.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.040
If someone loves me,

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.290
it's not your problem.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:48.650
Un.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.650
Get off me!

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.000
I told you to let me go!

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.140
Get off me!

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.350
Even after two years apart,

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.550
you've never really left my heart.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.210
You're selfish!

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.990
Un, I'm sorry.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:41.010
Un!

[Un In, Mr. Haran would like to postpone this class]

00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.110
It's good you didn't come.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.560
So we won't have to meet.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.790
Hi, dude.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.270
Dude, aren't you coming to the graduation party with us?

Heart just got promoted.

Can I postpone it to tomorrow?

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.140
I'll cover your mixers.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.290
You never change.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:28.680
Still glued to your man.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.560
Well.

Bye.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:35.650
Yeah.

I'm hanging up now.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.860
See you.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.970
Heart, you're back!

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.490
I miss you.

Are you tired?

I miss you.

Let me recharge.

I made your favorite food too.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.280
I already had a meal with a client.

I forgot to text you.

I'm sorry.

That's okay.

Un, are you angry with me?

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.630
Not at all.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:01.780
Then...

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.030
I'll go take a shower first.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.530
Un.

Shall we take a shower together?

You first.

I'm waiting for you.

Yes.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.270
Yes.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.730
I hope we can work together, Ann.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.800
That's all for now.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.630
Yes, good bye.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.730
Ann will be a partner at my company.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:05.350
My father assigned me to take care of this project after becoming vice president.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.110

Today Jane called me to invite me to celebrate our graduation.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.730
I'd like to join my friends at the party tomorrow.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:57.150
Sure.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.970
Tell me later when you want to go home.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:01.850
I'll pick you up.

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:07.120
Don't get too drunk.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:08.600
I'm worried about you.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:10.610
Yeah.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:12.840
I don't drink much.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.950
Since I have graduated

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.320
and our four year anniversary is approaching.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.330
Heart, shall we go on a trip?

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.050
We can go hiking, watch a meteor shower,

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.550
or paint ceramics at a cafe.

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:36.780
It's very interesting.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:38.260
But...

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.120
Let me check my schedule first.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.120
Fine.

Two restaurants contacted me for an interview today.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.310
But I want to continue studying to become better.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.850
But if I had the chance, I would like to be a singer.

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:10.150
What do you think I should do?

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.580
Is our relationship right now...

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.180
too distant?

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.200
I don't want to be childish with you.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.340
I want to be with you like this forever.
