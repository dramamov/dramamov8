Qin Nan.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.570
Sibei.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.130
You're awake.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.380
Qin Nan...

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.900
I'm sorry.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.610
I'm sorry.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.580
I'm sorry for...

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.900
I'm sorry for letting you
see the pathetic side of me.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.370
Stop apologizing to me.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.050
I don't need your apology.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.220
I should be the one apologizing.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.420
Actually...

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.220
Actually, that day,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.410
I was already waiting
for you down there.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.020
I saw the gates were locked,

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.810
and the lights off,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.100
so I thought you were already back home.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.330
If only...

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.340
If only I had...

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.810
If only I had called you...

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.900
I'm sorry.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.730
It's not your fault.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.050
It was an accident.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.490
No one could have expected it.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.540
Qin Nan.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.580
I want to make a police report.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.580
I'll make a police report.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.850
Okay.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.020
Once you're discharged,

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.490
we'll go to the police station.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.170
You'll win this time.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.370
Justice will be served.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.570
Your future...

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.050
will be very, very bright.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.460
If anyone scorns you,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.170
I'll bark back at them.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.370
If anyone bullies you,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.410
I'll whack them up.

00:07:16.844 --> 00:07:18.220
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.170
If anyone says otherwise,

00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:23.900
then it's them who did something wrong.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.740
Sibei.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.580
I'm your husband.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.220
I'll be with you.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.050
Ye Sibei.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.410
You have a home.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.050
You know?

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.410
We know you love fruit cake,

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.660
so we ordered one for you.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.540
Nianwen, call your sister.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.660
Ask her where she is.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:25.690
Sure.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.770
Allow me.

00:08:29.755 --> 00:08:31.060
You're still playing with that?

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.580
Open the lid

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.044
- and put the candles on.
- Okay.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.420
Nianwen.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.260
Hey, Nan.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.370
Mom's asking where you are now.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.060
We're not coming.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.060
You guys eat first.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:42.650
Fine.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.610
Ye Sibei's family?

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.460
Please sign here.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.060
Wait, Nan.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.850
Are you at the hospital?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.300
Is it my sister?

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.330
What happened?

00:08:51.422 --> 00:08:52.340
What happened to her?

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.300
What happened?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.220
Where are you now?

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:54.890
What happened?

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:55.700
Which hospital?

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.022
We're at People's Hospital.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.890
I knew it.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.580
What happened?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.020
What is it?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.420
Where are they now?

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.780
People's Hospital.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.490
Wait for me.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.020
Come on, Mr. Ye.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.420
(Happy Birthday!)

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.820
Students and teachers, walk forward.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.180
Stand according to your classes.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.490
Stand in line.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.340
Face towards me.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.250
Closer to each other.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.890
Okay, look here.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.220
Three.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.220
Two.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.060
One.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.420
Nan.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.010
Nan.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.890
How's my sister?

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.130
What happened to Sibei?

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:42.890
She's safe now.

00:10:43.244 --> 00:10:45.010
They're doing other checkups on her.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.010
No.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.300
She's always been fine.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.180
Why is she in the hospital?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.420
She drank a lot.

00:10:58.488 --> 00:10:59.730
It was alcohol poisoning.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.300
Where is she now?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.770
In the observation room.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.530
- Mom!
- Alcohol poisoning?

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.490
Why would a girl

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.580
drink so much alcohol?

00:11:10.688 --> 00:11:11.890
How was she drinking exactly?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.180
Weren't you supposed
to keep an eye on her?

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.010
What were you doing
when she was drinking?

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.180
Dad, pipe down.

00:11:17.222 --> 00:11:18.850
We'll talk about this
after Sibei is out.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.680
We can talk about it.

00:11:19.688 --> 00:11:20.980
Dad. Calm down.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.900
(Emergency)

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.010
Your family is a strange bunch.

00:12:47.022 --> 00:12:48.530
She's never been favored at home,

00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:50.770
but when she's in trouble,
you all act like

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.133
you've cared about her very much.

00:12:52.977 --> 00:12:54.220
Who are you trying to impress?

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.460
Our love is real,

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.820
but so are the deep-rooted perceptions

00:13:04.377 --> 00:13:05.530
ingrained in our family.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.940
For instance, my mom.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.890
She actually cares about Sibei.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.140
But she also thinks

00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:13.460
that women should just live like that.

00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:14.460
She didn't want

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.300
my sister to have a life beyond hers,

00:13:16.377 --> 00:13:18.355
yet she hoped my sister
could have a good life.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.511
And me...

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.820
You claimed I didn't want

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.650
my sister to go to the police

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.130
so that I wouldn't get implicated.

00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:32.377
(Ward Building)
Perhaps that's one of the factors.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.940
But I still believe that,

00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:35.749
compared to the nasty comments

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.488
she would face after lodging a report,

00:13:38.155 --> 00:13:40.044
it'd be better
if she didn't go to the police.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.300
Nan, you know what?

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.420
Making a police report
is just the beginning.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.420
After that, she'd be called in
to take statements

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.130
and retell her experience.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:48.980
She'd have to recall

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.650
those painful moments

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.130
and get judged by the public

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.500
who'd spread rumors about her.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.610
Then, there's the possibility
of failing her case.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.300
That's why

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.460
I was thinking...

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.300
I was thinking

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.010
that making my sister bear

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.740
and sacrifice so much...

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.820
Is it worth it?

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.140
Nianwen.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.730
Say, why do people pursue justice?

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.060
Because justice is
the basis of a well-lived life.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.220
If someone's world

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.770
doesn't even have basic justice,

00:14:28.577 --> 00:14:30.060
how do you expect her to believe

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.890
that she can live well in this world?

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.490
Other people can bully her

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:40.466
and get away with it.

00:14:40.466 --> 00:14:42.220
She paid in kindness,
yet received malice.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.770
How do you expect your sister
to accept a world like this?

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.690
Yes,

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.530
she chose to go to the police.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.100
She'd have to face many obstacles,

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.770
and she's actually struggling inside.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.180
If she does as you say

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.460
and gives up directly,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.177
things may seem peaceful on the surface,

00:14:56.222 --> 00:14:58.044
but the pain will torment her forever.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.100
Is there even absolute justice?

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.010
If there isn't,
why do we need you people?

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.010
You guys aspire to be lawyers,
prosecutors and judges

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.650
because you want to uphold justice

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.820
in this world, right?

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.690
You.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.820
Me.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.060
Ye Sibei.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.340
Every kindhearted person in this world

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.940
is working hard to live

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.300
because we pursue justice, right?

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.210
Hey, Mom.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:33.850
Nianwen.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.610
Your sister is missing.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.420
Where is my daughter?

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.850
How could she disappear?

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.300
How could you let her go?

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.220
Calm down and listen to us.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.850
Mom!

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.420
- Check the security footage!
- Don't worry, Mom.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.580
Calm down first!

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.580
How?

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.010
Call Ye Sibei, now!

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.850
Miss, did you see where she went?

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.460
- She was walking towards the corridor.
- If anything happens to her...

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.130
- I thought she was using the washroom.
- I'll make sure you pay!

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:54.850
So we didn't pay much attention...

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.300
Dad, keep an eye on Mom.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.040
Let's split and search.
Keep in touch by phone.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.130
We're going to search now.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.130
Right away.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.780
Wait for me.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:05.940
Sibei!

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.370
Hello, Sir.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.490
Have you seen a woman

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.288
wearing a patient's uniform
walk out of here?

00:16:12.288 --> 00:16:13.020
No.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.890
She looks like this.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:15.890
No, I haven't.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:16.490
You haven't?

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.330
No.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:22.700
(Multi-Service Counter)

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.130
Sibei!

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.380
Sibei!

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.380
Where are you going?

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.250
Mrs. Ye!

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.250
Let go of me!

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.380
- Calm down, Mrs. Ye!
- Let go of me!

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.770
Mrs. Ye!

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.620
Ye Sibei, what are you doing?

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.860
- Mom, not so hard!
- Let go of me!

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:21.620
Let go!

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.140
What in the world are you trying to do?

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:28.490
Where are you going?

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.060
Tell them

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.620
where you're going.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.900
I'm going to make a police report.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.220
Police?

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.330
For what?

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.140
On the night of April 9,

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.140
I didn't return home.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:07.730
I was raped.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.570
Nonsense!

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.060
That's nonsense.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.910
You...

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.010
You're crazy.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:21.860
Ye Sibei.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.220
How much longer are you keeping this up?

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.050
Qin Nan, you...

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.220
Go look for the doctor.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.140
Come.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:30.980
Come with me!

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.140
Mom, calm down.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.220
Hear her out!

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.050
I...

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.770
I'm going to seek justice for myself.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.380
I'm going to make a police report.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.940
I won't let you do that.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.770
I didn't let you then,

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.460
I'm not letting you now,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.380
and I won't let you go, even tomorrow!

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:02.860
Why?

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.860
You're asking why?

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.140
You're asking why?

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.570
So what if they find him

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.140
and prove that he's guilty?

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.140
Would that restore your chastity?

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.220
What would others say about you?

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.380
Have you thought about that?

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.730
I have.

00:19:22.577 --> 00:19:24.422
I'd live in pain
if I heard their gossip.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.140
But even if I hold back,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.620
would that stop the pain?

00:19:28.844 --> 00:19:30.380
Since both options are painful,

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.620
why do I need to hold back?

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.850
Sibei.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.010
That's how life is,
holding back your feelings.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.460
You...

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.940
Have you thought about us?

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.490
Qin Nan.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.050
And

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:45.940
your father.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.860
And

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.380
Nianwen and Chuchu.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.770
What about us?

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:50.940
What would people

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.330
say about our family?

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.570
And the two of them are getting married.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.860
What about their lives?

00:19:55.866 --> 00:19:57.180
You can't just think of yourself.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.620
How could you be so selfish?

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.730
Me, selfish?

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.140
Am I selfish?

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.250
You and Dad wanted a son,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.460
so you had me, then Nianwen.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.460
After that, you abandoned me
in the village for three years.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.490
When Dad lost his job

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.380
and we all lived in poverty,

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.490
I was blamed for being a jinx.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.570
So you're not selfish?

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.460
You wanted Nianwen
to attend a good school

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.890
and paid for his education.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.940
I didn't get a single cent
for my studies!

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.380
After graduating, I worked hard

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.770
and landed a decent job.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.250
You were worried
that no one would fend for you,

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.822
and you created a scene at my workplace,

00:20:38.844 --> 00:20:40.140
which made me lose my job

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.490
and forced me to move back here!

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.770
So you're not selfish?

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.860
When I got married,

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.220
and got a job,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.010
you never asked me

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.940
if I was okay,

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.660
or if Qin Nan and I

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.622
ever quarreled.

00:20:52.644 --> 00:20:55.050
But when Nianwen was planning
to get married and buy a house,

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.460
you came to me, asking for money.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.380
You think I don't need money?

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.010
You say that I'm selfish,

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.490
but what about you?

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.730
What have you done for me?

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.940
Even now, given my situation,

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.330
I don't expect you
to do anything for me.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.010
All I want is justice.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.460
Is that selfish of me?

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.770
You are selfish.

00:21:26.177 --> 00:21:27.940
I gave birth to you and raised you up.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.900
You say that I've never
done anything for you.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.050
Why do you think I'm stopping you

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.220
from filing a police report?

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.380
Why do you think

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.140
I'm stopping you from divorcing him?

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.730
Is it because of me?

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.140
It's because of you!

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.330
Then let me make my police report!

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.460
The reason I'm here now

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.490
and not at the rooftop

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.940
is that I want to send that scumbag

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.140
to jail!

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.620
I'm not even scared of dying.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.140
Do you think I'd fear what lies ahead?

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.220
Mom.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.900
If you still think of me
as your daughter,

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.140
let me go.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.330
Sibei.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.490
Go.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.180
I'll go with you to the police.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.460
I'm sorry.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.840
I was

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:07.790
an insensible kid.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.830
Actually, I knew what was going on.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.340
I could feel it.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.290
I just didn't dare think too much.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.530
I thought

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.140
that since I didn't do those things,

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.380
I didn't have to feel guilty.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.530
I thought I was deserving

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.140
of the benefits you gave me.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.570
That's why I never cared about you.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.530
Whenever something happened,

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.620
I was running away subconsciously.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.380
I made up excuses for myself.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.570
But I actually knew...

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.140
Sibei.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.250
You were right.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.420
I remember that back in class,

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.940
my teacher told me

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.290
that law itself is fighting against

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.290
the evil of this world.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.220
It's never been an easy path,

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.380
but someone has to trod it.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.730
If you don't fight for your own rights,

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.900
no one would ever know
what's right or wrong.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.780
Sibei.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.940
I didn't want you to go to the police

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.140
because I felt miserable,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.620
but I never asked you

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.900
if that was what you wished.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.620
If you want to do it now,

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.420
I'll come with you.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:35.860
Let's file a police report.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.380
No matter the results,

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.620
you're not the one at fault.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:49.650
Thank you.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:49.900
Do you feel unwell?

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:52.860
Are you feeling okay?

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:54.930
I'm good.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.860
I've never felt better.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.530
Nianwen, get in the car.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:07.470
Coming.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.300
Huang Guifen.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.980
How could you hide something

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.340
so important from me?

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.700
Are you blaming me now,

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.370
Mr. Ye?

00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:36.888
Would it make any difference?

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.620
Have you cared about anything

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.140
in this household?

00:26:46.422 --> 00:26:47.810
Don't you have any common sense?

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.490
She should have

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.380
gone to the police right away!

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.810
What you're doing now is
letting the rapist get off scot-free!

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.140
If anything

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.460
had happened to Sibei,

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.140
you'd be an accomplice to the rapist!

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.420
Go on.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.570
Of course, I will.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.210
Answer me.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.900
Why did you hide it from me?

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.330
Who do you think I am?

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.900
Ye.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.220
You're already
an old man in your sixties.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.380
How could you be as naive

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.140
as Qin Nan and Nianwen?

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.620
Why can't you understand anything?

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.460
Do you think that going to the police

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.460
would restore
your daughter's reputation?

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.860
I'm telling you,

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.250
it won't do any good to Ye Sibei.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.220
Fine.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.155
You think looking for the police
is the right thing to do?

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.050
She's going there now.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.140
Ye Ling, I'm telling you,

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.220
brace yourself.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.220
Be prepared for what's about to come.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.220
This is just the beginning.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.570
Are you coming?

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.740
(Police Reception)

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.380
Do you need any help?

00:28:12.577 --> 00:28:14.000
I'd like to lodge a police report.

00:28:23.888 --> 00:28:24.620
Have some water.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.860
Thank you.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.140
Why are you wearing a hospital uniform?

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.866
You could've changed
into something else.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.900
This must be urgent.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.570
I was worried that any longer,

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.460
and I'd never come.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.620
Ms. Ye,

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.900
don't be nervous.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.900
Once you're ready,

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.860
we can begin.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.810
Let's confirm your basic information.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.460
Your name.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.140
Ye Sibei.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:59.660
Age.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.620
28 years old.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.140
Address.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.660
503, Block 9, Fuxing Street, Nancheng.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:08.810
Place of work.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.620
Fuqiang Real Estate.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.140
Your case?

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.900
I've been raped.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:30.850
Nianwen.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.500
Sit down.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:44.360
Nan.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.930
Aren't you worried about my sister?

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.360
She's brave.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.010
Braver than any of us.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.010
Since when did you feel

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.900
that your mind was in a blurred state?

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.690
When I got in the car.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.180
Who else was in the car?

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:04.780
My friend,

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.060
who's also my brother's fiancée, Chuchu.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.090
And my superior,

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.570
Fan Jiancheng.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.090
You trust both of them, don't you?

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.010
Yes.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:17.420
Why do you

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.730
trust Fan Jiancheng?

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.060
Because I...

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.900
I thought he was a nice man.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.290
He was kind to all of us.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.300
Also,

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.730
he was the one who recruited me.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.300
I'm sorry.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.380
I'm sorry.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.220
It's okay.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.780
No rush.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.320
Relax, Sibei.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.810
After I got in the car,

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.730
I felt intoxicated.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.860
My mind was in an unclear state.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.620
When I woke up,

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.810
I realized I was in the car.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.980
When it ended...

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.300
What ended?

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.570
The rape.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.380
Please be specific.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.180
I heard...

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.460
Tick.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:13.650
Tick.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:14.850
Tick.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.900
A ticking mechanical sound.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.220
Then, I woke up.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.810
I felt...

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.250
I was probably at the back seat.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.180
I was blindfolded.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.940
I was laid down on a leather seat.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.460
It was narrow.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.660
He was on top of my body.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.920
Moving.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.940
When you said "moving",

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.810
did you mean he was touching you,

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.010
or was it

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:57.810
intercourse

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.490
or anything else?

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.810
Is it important?

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:03.650
It is.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.060
Intercourse.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.420
Was he

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.730
talking to you?

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.680
He was an aging man.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.510
Rough hands.

00:33:37.819 --> 00:33:38.419
Ye Sibei.

00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:40.929
You haven't told me what he said to you.

00:33:41.379 --> 00:33:42.659
Can I get a different officer?

00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:50.209
I understand how you feel.

00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:55.169
But even if we get you another officer,

00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:58.659
these are questions we have to ask.

00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:00.169
Are they necessary?

00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:02.379
It's all about seeking the truth.

00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:04.609
If it's for seeking the truth,

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:06.739
what I said earlier
should suffice, right?

00:34:07.209 --> 00:34:07.899
No.

00:34:07.899 --> 00:34:08.739
Why?

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.609
What's important should be

00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:11.339
who he is,

00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:13.339
and just arrest him, right?

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:17.609
Ms. Ye.

00:34:18.339 --> 00:34:19.649
The details

00:34:19.649 --> 00:34:21.219
are crucial to solving the case

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:22.929
and proving his guilt.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.449
I hope you can understand.

00:34:25.419 --> 00:34:27.529
To anyone other than you yourself,

00:34:27.529 --> 00:34:30.609
what you said may not be the truth.

00:34:31.339 --> 00:34:32.929
You have to be honest.

00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:36.089
Only honesty can represent the truth.

00:34:37.029 --> 00:34:38.699
What I'm saying is the truth.

00:34:38.819 --> 00:34:40.939
I'm being honest.

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:42.189
Then continue.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:45.899
The truth has to be spoken

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:48.179
and verified before
it can be acknowledged.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:50.699
It is a painful process, of course.

00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:53.339
But if you don't speak up,

00:34:53.649 --> 00:34:55.419
the truth will never emerge.

00:34:58.259 --> 00:35:00.179
What you will face in the future

00:35:00.179 --> 00:35:01.179
might be

00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:02.699
much crueler

00:35:03.699 --> 00:35:04.529
than this,

00:35:04.529 --> 00:35:05.369
and

00:35:05.649 --> 00:35:07.529
there will be tougher questions.

00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:18.699
If you can't even stand

00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:20.649
answering questions like this,

00:35:22.049 --> 00:35:25.089
your path would be difficult.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.782
Pretending, are you?

00:35:46.465 --> 00:35:47.472
"Pretending, are you?"

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.670
Yell!

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.300
Or else I'll kill you!

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.870
"Yell!"

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.840
"Or else I'll kill you!"

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.980
And then?

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:03.730
I yelled.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.220
(Case Processing Area,
No Entry Unless Permitted)

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.780
(Guantian Police Station)

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.620
Captain Zhang?

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.700
Qin Nan?

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.500
Captain Zhang.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.050
Ye?

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.275
Why are you guys here?

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.740
Sibei.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.990
Are you okay?

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.140
Ye Sibei

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.460
is my wife.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.660
Captain Zhang.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.530
I'm counting on you.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:46.300
Of course.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.500
It's my job.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.220
Ye Sibei.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.410
You did the right thing.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.780
Go home and rest.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.050
We'll inform you if there's anything.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.608
Captain Zhang still has the report

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:56.860
about your case from before.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.730
Don't worry.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.850
Thank you.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.930
Thanks, Captain Zhang.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.780
We're going home now.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:04.570
Okay.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:05.820
We'll keep you informed.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.820
Bye, Captain Zhang.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.660
Goodbye.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:17.820
Oh no.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.780
What is it?

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:21.650
I made a mistake.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.160
I need to make a report.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.450
Sibei.

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.410
Don't be scared.

00:37:34.431 --> 00:37:35.631
I've got everything planned out.

00:37:35.631 --> 00:37:36.570
I'll get my mentor,

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.130
Meng Xin, to represent you.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.260
He's amazing.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.860
He's helped

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.420
many people to seek justice.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.100
Okay.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.890
Sibei.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.780
Are you okay?

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.980
(I finally felt like)

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.730
(my future was no longer bleak.)

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.340
(Just unknown.)

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.460
Did you hurt your hand?

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.300
No.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.564
It's okay, you don't have to.

00:38:28.586 --> 00:38:29.940
I'm almost done, Sibei.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.380
Just one more.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.940
That's okay.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.460
I don't need it now.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.610
Sibei.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.730
I'm so sorry.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.650
Why are you apologizing?

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.820
I should've sent you
back home that night.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:06.500
I'm sorry.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.500
I'm so sorry.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.180
I'm sorry.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.650
You're a lady too.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.500
If he had sent me home first that night,

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.340
I'd probably be the one apologizing now.

00:39:20.075 --> 00:39:21.570
But when I left the car that night,

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.980
I really didn't notice.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.940
You were drunk.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:27.860
I don't blame myself.

00:39:28.831 --> 00:39:30.500
You shouldn't blame yourself, either.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.820
Sibei.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.820
What exactly happened that night?

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:41.260
Weren't you still fine

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.390
when I got out of the car?

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.420
I don't know, either.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.370
Sibei.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.380
It's over.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:56.970
Don't think too much.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.100
It's okay.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.500
Hey, Chuchu.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.340
Nan.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.100
Have you eaten?

00:40:13.231 --> 00:40:15.231
I was planning to do so
once you're here.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.050
I just dropped by to visit Sibei.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.820
See you, Sibei.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.860
Don't overthink it.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.820
You must be hungry.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.820
I've got egg soup

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:44.660
and congee.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.860
Which one do you want?

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.820
Egg soup, then.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.850
Sure.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.090
Eat up.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:51.300

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.820
Hello.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.900
Is Fan Jiancheng here?

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:11.490
Well...

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.980
Mr. Fan is in his office.

00:42:14.986 --> 00:42:16.053
I'll show you the way.

00:42:16.053 --> 00:42:17.075
Sure, thank you.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.660
This way.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.260
This way.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.980
You're Fan Jiancheng?

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.780
That's me.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.610
