[Love in The Clouds]

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.980
[Adapted from Bai Lu Cheng Shuang's "Love in The Clouds"]

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.980
[Episode 22]

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.140
Now that it has come to this,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.810
let's settle our public and personal grudges together.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.850
Mu Qibai.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.930
When you killed my master back then,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.980
you should've known you would end this way.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.930
You tortured and killed countless innocent people

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680
and brought netherbeasts to harm the Six Realms.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.680
The only ending you deserve

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.430
is to have your primordial spirit turn into ashes

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.560
to appease the spirits of those you've killed.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.100
You've lost, Mu Qibai.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.930
You don't deserve to die in my hands.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.560
Quick, everyone! Hide behind us!

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.810
Hide behind us, hurry!

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.060
Mu Qibai is indeed useless.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.770
There's no need to worry.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.940
The netherbeast army will devour and destroy Jixing Abyss.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.020
Ming Xian,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.850
if you are there as well,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.480
you should die with them.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.480
Take care.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.060
Protect Jixing Abyss with our lives!

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.930
Yes!

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.980
Why?

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.100
Why?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.180
When we were young, didn't we agree

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.850
to protect Jixing Abyss together?

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.770
For so many years,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.390
the weak can only look up to the strong.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.060
We begged for pity

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.140
yet we still wouldn't be treated fairly.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.020
If Jixing Abyss is just barely surviving,

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.850
it might as well be destroyed.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.980
If you were on my side,

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.310
we could have gotten more blessings

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.020
at the cost of a few lives.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.700
We could've succeeded!

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.980
Foolish!

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.640
You brought trouble

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.340
and invited danger to our place.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.890
You have no right to decide other people's lives for them!

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.600
Why have the netherbeasts suddenly become stronger?

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.560
Once the netherbeasts go on a rampage,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.140
they won't even obey their master's order.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.780
They might even strike back at their master.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.390
When the time comes, the whole Jixing Abyss

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.220
and even the Six Realms will be in torment.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.520
Is this what you want?

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.980
I can rule the Six Realms with the netherbeasts.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.890
Jixing Abyss will no longer be bullied by anyone else.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.980
How do you know that I can't succeed?

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.980
You are no longer

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.520
the tough brother

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.140
who rose to the challenge

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.480
in my memory.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.810
Why have you become so weak

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.600
for the sake of peace?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.430
You're a coward who compromises.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.140
You should've worked with Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.060
- We could've... - There's no working together!

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.700
If we had done that,

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.660
you'd only become a political hostage.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.410
I wanted you to stay by my side

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.460
so I could protect you better.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.020
In the end, I still failed.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.140
Bai.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.900
Can you...

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.250
Can you forgive me?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.340
In the past,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.730
I thought my brother was a great hero

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.420
who could rise to greatness.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.770
Now, I have finally realized

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.370
that everything

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.650
is just a fleeting dream.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.650
The netherbeasts are going to devour everyone!

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.730
Hold on!

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.370
Don't give up!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.460
Hold on.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.490
The netherbeasts have completely lost control.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.300
There's only one way now.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.010
What if I say,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.220
instead of you protecting me,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.340
why don't

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.980
we protect each other?

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.300
Xun Ming mentioned Heartbond Array in the Illusory Realm.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.580
Ancient tomes also said

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.180
that it could seal netherbeasts.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.130
To use the array, the spellcasters must be of one mind and one heart.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.300
If not,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.490
they will be caught in self-immolation.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.820
And it's precisely due to this high risk

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.180
that no one has practiced it since then.

If that's what we have to do,

then it's not that complicated.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.010
After all,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.650

will only succeed when two people are of the same mind.

That's great!

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.730
It's a success.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.650
We survived.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.700
That's great!

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.610
The Heartbond Array.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:00.940
That's great.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.340
We did it.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.980
Wonderful!

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:11.850
Ming Yi!

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.340
It's over.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.130
Great!

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.340
Great!

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.820
Almost there. Hold on.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.650
Twenty-Seven.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.490
I coughed up blood because you were rushing me.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.220
How can you

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.650
still joke at a time like this?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.100
Thankfully,

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.490
there's one petal left.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.100
Ming Yi,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.700
we run out of time.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.460
If this goes on,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.060
you won't even last until the Prayer Night is over.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.060
The Heavenly Grief will kill you soon.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.580
I can hold on.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.820
Don't worry.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.300
I'm still alive.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.340
How can you still smile?

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.340
If something went wrong when using the Heartbond Array,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.340
the spellcasters would die.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.940
I was so worried.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.650
Thankfully, you and Ji Bozai

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.700
are of the same mind.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.420
What's wrong?

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:45.370
No.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.460
- I'll go and find Ji Bozai now - Twenty-Seven.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.580
and ask him to give you the Golden Millet Dream.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.300
Twenty-Seven.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.610
If you

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.610
tell him

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.700
that I'm doing everything to stay by his side

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.420
just to obtain the Golden Millet Dream,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.060
what will he think of me?

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.660
You are different from other people.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.620
Both of you have gone through so much.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.730
Ji Bozai likes you.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.570
If he knows you are poisoned by Heavenly Grief,

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.010
he will surely save you.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.290
How are you doing?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.940
I didn't see you just now.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.530
The Heartbond Array exhausted all my spiritual power

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.180
but you don't seem affected.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.330
How annoying.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.490
Are you really fine?

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.290
You don't believe me

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.140
and asked me twice.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.980
This is unlike you.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.980
Were you afraid?

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.330
Yes.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.900
For a moment just now,

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.050
I thought you had left.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.490
I told you

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.380
that you could never escape.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.220
However, if you want to leave,

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.330
I won't stop you.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.090
The Prayer Night has just begun.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.940
It'll last for three long nights.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.620
I'll let you decide.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.010
Father's Blood Moon Ring?

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.730
I thought Qibai poisoned me

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.900
but it was a drug that made me lose my spiritual power and faked my death.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.810
It was all my fault

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.330
for not doing my duty as his brother to guide him.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.660
Uncle deserved it.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.810
You are not at fault.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.180
Don't be too upset, Father.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.730
Zhushui will never give up now.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.010
So, we must tighten our defenses.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.730
Conflicts between the Six Realms are showing.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.980
The intensity of Shouhua Academy's training

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.420
should be increased as well.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.700
Jixing Abyss can only be proactive

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.730
if it maintains its Upper Three Realms status.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.380
Father,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.180
I still have one thing to inform you.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.730
I made the announcement

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.570
that Soul-hiding Nails would no longer be planted

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.250
in every fairy of Jixing Abyss with spiritual veins.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.220
I will also recruit females into Shouhua Academy

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.980
as warriors.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.490
Is it because of Fairy Ming Yi?

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.730
It's not just because of Ming Yi.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.050
I think

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.090
fairies who have spiritual veins

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.330
haven't done anything wrong.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.620
If people are worried that they might rebel with a netherbeast army,

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.940
that's even more ridiculous.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.980
The ones who started a rebellion

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.810
were obviously Uncle and Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.620
Yan Xiao had acted as a double agent

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.980
for me and Qibai in the last few years.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.810
Qibai made me pass out.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.220
Yan Xiao used his power in secret

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.180
to keep me safe.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.420
He didn't tell me

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.730
but I could feel it.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.010
Perhaps he is not the person we've seen on the surface.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.490
Yan Xiao might have followed Qibai for many years,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.900
but he should be spared from all the punishments

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.010
now that he has turned around.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.660
He no longer needs to feel bad about his origins

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.620
and should only focus on serving Jixing Abyss.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.420
Tianji,

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.140
how I treat him

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.330
isn't important.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.730
The most important thing is what you think of him.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.570
Your Highness.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.900
The immortals who were attacked by the netherbeast army

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.050
have been attended to.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.010
Cast your worry aside.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.700
Do you have something else to say to me?

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.380
When would you

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.570
ever stop deceiving me

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.050
if I hadn't seen you work with Ji Bozai?

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.980
Am I not worthy of your trust?

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.770
No, I...

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.900
Tianji,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.700
I was born into a low status.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.490
I served Mu Qibai

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.700
to repay him for his tutelage.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.660
I also used him to rise higher.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.620
In the beginning, he told me

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.140
everything he did

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.140
was to make Jixing Abyss truly powerful.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.700
I used to believe in him.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.330
Later,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.090
I saw him doing all those evil deeds in secret.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.900
I saw how he neglected the lives of others.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.700
That was when I knew I was wrong.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.050
You could've told me then.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.900
We could've come up with a plan together.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:42.980
Don't you know how dangerous it is

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.900
to do things alone?

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.660
Or perhaps you don't care about me at all.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.410
I...

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.900
He didn't use a flower to cast a spell to enter previously.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.330
What is he trying to do?

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.380
Why are you so surprised?

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.570
You came here to save me back then,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.570
didn't you?

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.980
[Hou Zhao]

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.780
[Xun Ming]

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.860
[Mu Qibai]

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.180
Master, may you rest in peace.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.250
Ming Yi,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.380
I haven't told you about my past

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.220
with my master, have I?

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.180
Back then, I was in a dire situation

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.330
after escaping from the Sunken Abyss.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.330
However, the Heavenly Grief took effect

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.490
and I almost died.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.730
Coincidentally,

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.180
Master was a wandering doctor of the Bo family

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.010
who gathered herbs and healed others.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.010
She found me,

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.620
barely alive, near the Sunken Abyss.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.860
This is a medicine that slows the poison of Heavenly Grief.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.010
Drink it and you'll feel better.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.570
In the beginning, I didn't believe in her.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.940
However, Master did her best to cure me.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.730
I was grateful

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.730
and called her my master.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.490
The Bo family developed Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.420
which caused chaos in the Six Realms.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.900
So, they warned their descendants

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.770
not to make them again.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.460
However, Master disobeyed her ancestral rules

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.090
and made the Golden Millet Dream

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.290
to save me.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.460
In the end, she died in Mu Qibai's hands.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.660
We were strangers who crossed paths,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.700
but she saved me

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.810
and it cost her life.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.900
I couldn't repay her in any way.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.640
Master left a dying wish.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.380
She would not let anyone obtain the Golden Millet Dream.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:04.940
So, I decided

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.140
to hide the Golden Millet Dream once and for all.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.250
Later, I made the Spirit Well,

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.250
joined the Qingyun Tournament,

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.420
and approached the nobles of Jixing Abyss

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.660
to avenge Master.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.700
You went through so many difficulties.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.810
Fortunately,

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.770

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.290
Not at all.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.810
Something feels off about you.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.730
How so?

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.900
Do people sell lanterns during the Prayer Night?

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.620
I heard they are pretty.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.770
The lanterns are for the people you love.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.700
Stop dreaming.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.730
No one likes you.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.730
What a joke.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.420
Is there anyone who doesn't like cats?

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:37.900
I also heard

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.460
there are flying dance performances on the Prayer Night.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.810
Fly for me.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.980
Do you want a beating?

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:44.770
You...

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.290
I want to see the fireflies. Can I?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.250
Seriously.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.570
It's the Prayer Night.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.330
It's the grandest festival in Jixing Abyss every year.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.460
So no lanterns

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.660
and no flying dance performance.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.900
I just want to see the fireflies.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.140
I'm not asking for anything else.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.700
I just want

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.180
to see the fireflies in the sky like bright stars.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.330
There are no such rules for the Prayer Night.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.050
Don't make them up.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.770
So I can't have this or that.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.860
Did I come to Jixing Abyss just to suffer?

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.810
Why are you here

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.730
if not to suffer?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.860
Travel around?

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.460
- You... - How annoying.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.700
Granny Xun.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.290
Are you complaining about me as well?

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.010
I...

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.050
I can't live here anymore.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.900
Ming Yi,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.700
have you gotten the Golden Millet Dream?

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.490
What a childish trick.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.180
He helped His Lordship suppress the netherbeast army after all.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.050
Whether Ming Xian is a friend or a foe,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.570
we are all on the same side on this.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.770
Before Ming Xian comes back to retrieve Twenty-Seven,

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.620
we can live peacefully with each other.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.700
If Ming Xian comes back,

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.700
will he bring Ming Yi away as well?

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.730
That wretched Ming Xian.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:39.290
Dream on!

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.940
Fragrance pouches!

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.860
Come and take a look.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.090
Fragrance pouches!

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.490
Pibo shawl!

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.330
Lanterns!

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.090
Fairy,

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.090
get yourself a Pibo shawl.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:32:59.640
Take a look.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.740
Pibo shawls!

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.000
Ming Yi,

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.530
it's the Prayer Night.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.130
Unfortunately, I have work to do.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.730
I hope we can still celebrate the festival together next year.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.300
Here's a Blessing Flower for you.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.620
Situ Ling.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.340
Ming Yi?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.780
Wasn't he addressing you as Sister Yi previously?

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.930
You said you told your master about me.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.690
What did you tell her?

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.580
Do you want to know?

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.620
Not really.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.060
Back then, I told her...

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.340
I told her

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.860
I didn't care about everything in the past.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.860
Your identity is also not important to me.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.010
I'm sure that you care about me sincerely.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.970
No matter what happens in the future,

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:03.490
I trust you.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.780
The Grief Blossom only has one petal left

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.570
and it is starting to wilt.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:12.900
Ming Yi,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.570
you are running out of time.

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.580
Xianxian.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.670
Ruoning!

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.570
Miss, which one do you want?

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.020
This item can help you ward off evil.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:32.780
Sorry.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.010
Aren't you Zhang Tai?

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.660
Did you serve Xun Ming previously?

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.570
The general is dead.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:44.050
How can a widow like you show yourself in public

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.860
and run a stall?

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.180
How funny!

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.660
Funny?

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.740
What's so funny about it?

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.900
I like to show myself in public.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.930
It's none of your business.

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:55.300
Stop!

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.090
Apologize to me!

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.530
You...

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.090
How could you use your spiritual vein?

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:04.970
Great.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.570
You don't have Soul-hiding Nails in you?

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.300
You assaulted her first.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.970
Whether a fairy has a Soul-hiding Nail or not is none of your business.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.820
Stop while you still can.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.410
Thank you.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.570
I am Zhang Tai.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.130
You are...?

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.720
[Zheng Tiao, Warrior of Flowing Wave Gorge]

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.410
Zheng Tiao.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.340
Immortal Zheng, you are from Flowing Wave Gorge.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.740
Do you travel to Jixing Abyss often?

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:52.010
Not at all.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.970
However, I heard the stars here are pretty

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.610
so I want

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.900
to take a look during the Prayer Night.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.860
That's easy.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.700
Today's weather is good.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.760
Let me show you around.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.660
Wonderful!

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.200
Thank you, Your Highness!

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.660
Your Highness, thank you for making the announcement!

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.660
Fairies no longer need Soul-hiding Nails in them.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.820
We can finally use our spiritual veins

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.740
and have a chance to become warriors!

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.130
- Thank you, Your Highness! - Thank you, Your Highness!

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:30.930
Thank you, Your Highness!

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.410
Thank you, Your Highness!

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.490
Thank you, Your Highness!

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.340
Go and pray for your blessing, everyone.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.740
- Thank you, Your Highness! - Thank you, Your Highness!

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.700
Thank you, Your Highness!

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.860
Thank you, Your Highness!

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.930
May the stars shine forever and the Blessed Raid befall us.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.010
May the stars shine forever and the Blessed Raid befall us.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.610
All of them can pray in peace.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.220
Our efforts to protect everything by sacrificing ourselves are not in vain.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.610
Looking at this,

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.780
isn't it worth it?

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.180
I feel it was worth it

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.780
even if I'm not from here.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.090
However, I'm surprised to hear you ask me that question.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:06.880
- That's great! - It's so great!

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.050
It's like you are no longer

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.380
the Ji Bozai who only cares about getting revenge.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.780
However, this is not enough.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.260
Zhushui Spiritual State will not give up.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.180
We don't know how many people in the Six Realms

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.530
are involved in this.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.410
After all, everyone wants absolute power.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.740
If we are facing more foes,

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.780
it'll only be more difficult in the future.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.130
We?

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.860
If someone from Yaoguang Mountain is involved,

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.090
will you still

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.010
hold firm to your beliefs?

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.220
You know I won't.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.660
However, I...

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.090
I also have my own concerns.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.610
Let's go and have fun.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.220
Just like how we did it when we were children.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.090
I'll make a puppet to stand in your stead.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.700
I am

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.130
different now.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.740
Right now, I think

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.930
protecting them

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:42.900
gives me another form of joy.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.660
Then, I bring the most delicious Blessing Cake

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.610
and the prettiest lantern

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.410
to you.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.780
I hope my baby can grow up healthy.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.700
Come and make a wish. Hurry.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.300
♪Unforgettable love turned out to be a spell♪

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:31.460
♪That made me lose myself...♪

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.980
I've caught it as well!

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.490
Make a wish!

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.900
♪Though stubborn, I am held fast by love♪

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:56.020
♪It is you who taught me to understand♪

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.340
But you are different.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.820
If he knows you are poisoned by Heavenly Grief,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.220
he will surely save you.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.410
I have something to tell you.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.930
I...

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.930
Mu Qibai is dead.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.340
For that, you avenged Ming Xian who was poisoned by him.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.220
You owe neither him

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.300
nor me.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:38.700
So, you are free.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.930
I told you

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.860
I wanted

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.010
an answer after three days.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.130
I also want the truth.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.070
However, I'm afraid...

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.610
I thought

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.050
I would do everything to make you stay.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.380
However, at this moment,

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:13.530
I also hate to put you in a difficult position.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.130
My Lord,

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.530
you are not hiding anything from me now.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.220
Aren't you afraid that I might want something from you?

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.860
What do you want from me?

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:32.220
Golden Millet Dream?

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.740
Everyone in the Six Realms wants my Golden Millet Dream,

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.090
except for you.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.340
What if I tell you

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.090
that I also want the Golden Millet Dream?

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.740
Haven't you seen it already?

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.780
In the Spirit Well,

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:54.660
you had so many opportunities to grab it.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.700
No?

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.130
Yes.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.740
Why do you trust me so much?

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:08.780
What?

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.010
This is...

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.900
You gave this to me back then.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.410
Ji Bozai is very cautious.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.740
He will not drink the wine you give him.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.130
It's fine.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.820
He might not drink it now,

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:56.780
but he might in the future.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.700
I thought you didn't drink something given to you by outsiders.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.700
That's not true.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:10.930
What do you mean?

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.740
It's not from an outsider.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.490
I've kept the wine for so long.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.740
I finally have the chance

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.860
to drink with you now.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.090
What?

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.900
Did you drug the wine?

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:44.380
I did.
