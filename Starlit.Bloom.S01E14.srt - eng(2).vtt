- Let's go.
- All right.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.640
Hey.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.270
What to do?

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.870
I'm really not in the mood to work.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.200
I just want to go on a date.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.870
Secretary Lu,
this line is for business calls only.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.960
Can you hear my heartbeat?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.200
Thump...

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.920
Ah!

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.390
Mm.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.990
You're my girlfriend now.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.240
So...

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.110
When can we go on a date?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.990
I'm free after work tonight.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.550
(That's my girlfriend.)

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.710
(That's my girlfriend!)

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480
Yes? Mo Li?

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.366
Liusu. Can you talk right now?

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.360
What's up?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.520
I just got to the office.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.960
I wanted to go over

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.155
the guest list
for the charity auction with you.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.390
Okay. I'll be right there.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.760
I'm here to give my report.

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:28.390
Where are you headed?

00:04:30.177 --> 00:04:33.080
Since when does the boss have
to report her schedule to her secretary?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.350
I'm coming too!

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.830
What's the matter, Mo Li?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.270
Liusu.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.790
You called so early. It sounded urgent.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.790
Wait at another table.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.270
Liusu.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.200
Give me a cup of coffee.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.019
I wanted to show you

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.080
the tentative guest list

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.560
for the charity auction.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.520
Sure.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.560
Some are long-time brands,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.270
others are new.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.220
Everyone on the list
has been vetted financially.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.440
- There are no shell companies.
- Thank you.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.440
You're thorough.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.266
Now I see why Mr. Lu
speaks so highly of you.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.150
Even high salaries can't lure you away.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.880
Mr. Lu has always been good to me.

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:30.177
When someone shows you kindness,
you return it tenfold.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.080
One more thing I want to run by you.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.440
Yes?

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.350
Would you consider

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.960
inviting Mr. Lin from Xinyi Group?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.120
Mr. Lin might be ruthless in business,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.200
but regardless of motive,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.710
he has donated a lot to the orphanage.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.030
Still,

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.560
I'd like to hear your opinion.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.640
Invite him. We should.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.150
Should, my foot!

00:06:05.355 --> 00:06:07.560
That old man Lin Xiang
bribed reporters to smear you,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.390
stole your diamonds,

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.980
and even got handsy with you at dinner.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.960
Can't you stand up
for yourself for once?

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.760
Mr. Xingchen.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.790
A secretary
doesn't make decisions for his boss.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.320
You like Liusu, don't you?

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.200
Mind your words.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.640
We're just colleagues.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.440
All right.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.590
If you say so.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.760
Then, let me make an announcement.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.080
Gu Liusu

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.000
is my girlfriend now.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.710
So, you don't have a shot anymore.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.270
Also,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.680
I don't want scum like Lin Xiang
anywhere near her.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.830
We should still go
with Ms. Liusu's decision.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.960
Decision, my foot!

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.560
What's with all this righteousness talk?

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.000
Do what makes yourself happy.
That's what really matters.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.030
Besides, Lin Xiang's an old snake.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.760
Don't be fooled by his donations.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.120
He's just putting on a show.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.320
Like he'd ever turn good

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.511
because of one invitation.

00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:16.560
Keep dreaming!

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.760
Anyway,

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.440
I can't be by my girlfriend's side
twenty-four seven.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.350
I just want her
to think of herself first

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.270
whenever she decides something.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.590
Lu Xingchen, where do you come up
with all this nonsense?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.320
Go back to your seat, Secretary Lu.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.640
So what do you say, Liusu?

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.790
I lied.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.390
I don't want to see Lin Xiang.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.880
If possible,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.288
I never want to see him again.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.230
Okay.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.520
I'll revise the guest list.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.230
Mm.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.320
Thank you.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.710
I have other things to attend to.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.390
I'll head back.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.910
Okay.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.710
Mr. Lu's been running a fever for days.

00:08:17.022 --> 00:08:19.955
Secretary Lu, maybe you should go home
and check on your family too.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.111
Is he jealous of me?

00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:30.640
Can't win an argument,
so he throws my dad in my face.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.440
Secretary Lu, when I'm working outside,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.200
can you please stop following me around?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.470
I refuse.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.320
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.800
From now on,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.870
I'll try to remember to put myself first
before making any decisions.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.160
Let me put it on for you.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.060
(Tea)

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.510
Your son's here.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.320
Come in!

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.560
You're already here. Come inside!

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.630
Come on!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.400
Lu.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.960
Take a seat.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.750
Here you go. You two have a nice chat.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.680
(Tang Baozhu)
(Bestie, you're a miracle worker!)

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.590
(Lu Xingchen actually came back!)

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.350
(Gu Liusu)
(It wasn't all me.)

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.160
(He needed a reason
to convince himself.)

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.990
Why do you think I work myself
to the bone every day?

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.920
I do it all for our family!

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.440
Have you even thought about Xingchen?

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.110
So you get to work,

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.560
but I can't, and I have
to stay home with the boy?

00:11:32.622 --> 00:11:33.510
He's not just my son.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.800
He's yours too!

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.750
How can you say that?

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.320
Are you even fit to be a mother?

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.040
Listen.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.044
If you can't handle this,
let's just get divorced!

00:11:40.044 --> 00:11:41.044
Fine by me!

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.830
Li, take him to school.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.990
How's work at GL?

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.320
Fine.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.750
I heard you exposed Lin Xiang

00:12:14.955 --> 00:12:16.400
for bribing reporters to smear GL.

00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:18.333
You've offended a lot of senior figures.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.080
What are you going to do now?

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.470
Gu Liusu said

00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:26.333
she's not planning
to make any other moves for now.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.040
Besides,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.870
Lin Xiang doesn't deserve
to be called a "senior" anything.

00:12:30.955 --> 00:12:32.400
I don't care if I offended him.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.830
Liusu is being cautious, as always.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.800
You, on the other hand,
are still too young.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.160
You always say such immature things.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.230
You look fine to me.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.110
I'll get going.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.230
You should consider retiring soon.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.630
If your health goes,

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.710
no amount of money will matter.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.160
Retire?

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.920
If you won't come back to the company,

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.080
who am I supposed to hand it to?

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.440
To someone capable.

00:13:29.377 --> 00:13:30.733
It's a new era.

00:13:30.733 --> 00:13:32.820
Inheritance isn't passed down
just by family anymore.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.630
That Mo Li

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.680
might be stiff and uptight,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.750
but he's good at his job.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.830
Let him take on more

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:42.920
and you can finally rest.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.920
But he's not family.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.160
No matter what you say,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.830
Mo Li will always be an outsider.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.320
You can't hold on to it.
