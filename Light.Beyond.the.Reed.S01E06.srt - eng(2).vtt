00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.410
(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
=Episode 6=

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.490
But this...

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.820
It must be a mistake.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.570
Whether there's a mistake or not,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.930
we just have to investigate it.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.570
I know Commissioner Wang.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.330
Why don't I

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.980
call him and ask him about this?

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.044
If you don't cooperate with us,

00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:08.710
we have no choice
but to summon you to cooperate with us.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I'll cooperate with you.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.170
Of course, I will.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.570
However,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.780
I have

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.890
a few important documents to work on.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.500
I must sign them.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.340
It's all right.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.570
It'll just take a bit of time.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.340
Sure.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.660
You are busy. We'll wait for you.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.410
All right.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.170
Thank you.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.260
Please sit down.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.130
We'll wait for you.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.620
In that case,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.660
suit yourselves.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.220
Mr. Fan,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.260
do you like panthers?

00:03:05.888 --> 00:03:06.970
It's just an accessory.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.660
An accessory.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.500
Not bad.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.580
(Law and Morals, Crimes and Punishment)

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.220
You have

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.340
so many books about law here.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.100
You know the law.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.540
Law is a weapon.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.340
It's tough doing business.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.780
We need to use the law as a weapon

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.610
to protect ourselves,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.380
right?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.610
That's absolutely right.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.666
We should all know the law.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.290
We can only obey the law by knowing it.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.290
Yes.

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:32.940
If all the common people like us

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.980
know, understand, and obey the law,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.380
won't that make our jobs easier

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.610
as police officers?

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.780
Yes.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.100
Fuqiang

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.980
is quite famous in Nancheng.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.540
Our company

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.780
is just a small company

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.980
with only 30 people.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.690
Tao Jie.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.690
Mr. Fan.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.980
I just signed these few documents.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.980
They are very important.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.500
Deal with them immediately.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.450
Yes.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.250
Thank you.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.140
All right.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.050
You're done?

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.900
Let's go.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.980
Let's go.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.860
This way, please.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.820
Let's go.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.220
Everything's fine.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.020
Just complete your tasks.

00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.836
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.060
Mom.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.330
Where are you going?

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.580
I'm just going to take a stroll.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.370
Have you heard?

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.100
Fuqiang Real Estate is in trouble.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.580
I heard.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.490
I also heard

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.170
their superior was taken away
by the police.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.730
What? Did someone die?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.410
Not really.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.370
However, I heard

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.100
a woman

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.730
was...

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.410
What do you mean?

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.220
What else? It's that.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.170
You are so stupid.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.660
It's that thing.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.980
I get it.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.490
You should go back to the ward.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.810
I'll go and find the doctor.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.540
You're awake?

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.770
Sibei,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.100
where were you?

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.220
I went downstairs to take a stroll.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.330
Are you hungry?

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:40.660
Let me buy you some food.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.370
It's fine. My mother sent me food.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.250
You can go to work.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.490
She went to see the doctor

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.340
and will be back soon.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.500
All right.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.780
I'll go to the shop.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.100
Call me if you need anything.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.850
Officer,

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:31.770
this...

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.650
I'm sure this isn't necessary.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.940
Didn't you ask me
to assist in your investigation?

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.810
Why did you...

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.460
This is just a normal procedure.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.370
On the night of 9th April,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.577
a rape case happened
at the rapeseed flower field

00:08:43.577 --> 00:08:44.422
on the outskirts.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.770
The victim was Ye Sibei.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.770
Did you do it?

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.370
Tell us honestly.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.370
Ye Sibei?

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.820
Rape?

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.330
No.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.060
Well...

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.370
I don't know about it.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.220
You must have made a mistake.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.980
Stop acting clueless.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.220
Since we've summoned you here,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.940
we must have required some evidence.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.980
Officer,

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.530
what's your surname?

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.330
Lin.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.730
Officer Lin,

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.300
I believe
there must be a mistake in this.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.770
This is ridiculous.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.490
I will never...

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:30.980
Why don't you

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.420
call Ye Sibei here?

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.980
I'll talk to her. How about that?

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.644
What's your relationship with Ye Sibei?

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.220
We are colleagues.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.770
I thought Ye Sibei
had quite a difficult time.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.490
Usually,

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.530
I would try to help her out
as much as I could.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.890
I didn't expect
it would turn out this way.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.820
What do you mean
she had quite a difficult time?

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.130
Ye Sibei

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.220
is unsociable.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.577
She doesn't like to speak much.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.220
Someone with her personality

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.300
isn't suitable

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.530
for our line of work.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.610
I mean the work of a salesperson.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.300
In the beginning,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.060
the company did not plan to hire her.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.650
When I saw her,

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.420
it felt like
the world was ending for her.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.533
Out of kindness, I asked her

00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:21.770
and she told me
she came from the provincial capital.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.890
She couldn't find work here

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.300
and her family background is bad.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.370
I was worried
that she might do something foolish,

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.220
so

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.300
I discussed with the company

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.610
and hired her.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.980
After all, she's a university graduate.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.370
What happened next?

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.980
She's a serious worker,

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.370
but she hasn't been

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.980
getting along well

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.610
with her colleagues.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.900
Why?

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.250
After all,

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.730
it's because she's unsociable.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.220
All her colleagues

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.220
think

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.730
she's from the provincial capital

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.300
and a university graduate,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:55.980
so

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.460
she looks down on everyone.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.580
Her department manager
told me many times

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.490
that she wanted to fire her.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.370
I thought

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.220
Ye Sibei wasn't that kind of person.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.250
Out of kindness,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.060
I investigated in private.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.850
In the end,
I realized that was the truth.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.180
The main reason
was that she's too quiet.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.850
So, I spoke

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.100
to everyone in her department

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.770
and finally settled this issue.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.180
The doctor said you could be discharged.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.250
You should get changed.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.770
Every reading is normal.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.130
Right?

00:11:39.688 --> 00:11:40.822
Let's recuperate at home.

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.650
I heard Ye Sibei
wanted to apply for a loan.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.300
You even made
a fake income statement for her.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.770
This must be illegal.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.300
Ye Sibei came to me and said

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.370
her younger brother
is getting married.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.770
She wanted to buy a house,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.770
but her family isn't well-off.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.490
She wanted me
to make a fake proof of income.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.488
I told her many times

00:12:13.488 --> 00:12:15.155
that buying a house is a huge decision.

00:12:15.177 --> 00:12:17.750
She should not do something
that exceeds her capabilities.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.420
However,

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.180
she kept coming to me.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.130
Out of kindness,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.730
I helped her.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.300
Why do you care about Ye Sibei so much?

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.250
Officer Lin,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.180
do you think
there's something between us?

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.130
I don't blame you, actually.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.980
Her husband also thought the same.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.100
You may ask around the company.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.850
I treat every employee of the company

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.250
the same.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.490
Not just Ye Sibei.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.180
I try my best to help

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.420
every employee of the company.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.130
For example,

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.300
the dinner gathering that day.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:54.980
The girls were drinking a lot,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.370
and I did my best to stop them.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.250
Women shouldn't

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.980
drink that much, right?

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.130
Two days ago, Ye Sibei

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.370
asked me for a day off,
and she was even absent from work.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.730
I was quite angry back then

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.180
because we were very busy.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:08.850
Later, she told me

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.300
she was not feeling well,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.770
so I approved her day off.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:29.900
(Turn Around While You Still Can)

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.490
Master,

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.180
why aren't we questioning him further?

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.770
Don't you think

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.300
his statement just now
was made up beforehand?

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.850
If he did do it,

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.533
he would've had a perfect lie for it.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.090
Then...

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.980
We still can't let him off the hook.

00:13:59.022 --> 00:14:00.733
I'm not saying
that we're letting him go.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.300
We'll keep waiting.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.610
What are we waiting for, Master?

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.730
Walk faster.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.060
Wait.

00:14:20.577 --> 00:14:21.850
You should wear this, as well.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.770
You look good.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.220
Mom, I can go back on my own.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.650
I feel bad seeing you like this.

00:14:45.777 --> 00:14:47.060
- Don't find me again.
- Sibei.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.100
- I don't want to trouble you.
- What do you mean?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.220
I'm not using this.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.730
Sir, Jinxiu Residential Area.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:53.890
What do you mean?

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.780
This child...

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.730
(Police)
What do you do

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.650
in Fuqiang Real Estate?

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.370
I am

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.130
the company's financial director.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.730
Were you there at the gathering

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.570
on 9th April?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.060
I was there at the gathering.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.888
We invited
Mr. Zheng from Wanfu Properties

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:22.933
to have dinner that day.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.770
They had a project

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.770
that our company
had wanted for a long time

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.220
so we prioritized the gathering.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:28.940
So,

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.780
that day,

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.650
Mr. Fan called everyone

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.060
who was still at work to the gathering.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.010
How much did you drink

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.490
that night?

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.890
On the night of the gathering,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.650
I drank about

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.770
a quarter of a liter.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.100
As an employee

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.610
of the sales department,

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.460
I have to drink

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.460
during gatherings.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.340
However, that day,

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.100
we had Mr. Zheng,

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.220
who loved drinking,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:56.940
so

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.010
all of us

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.850
who went had to drink

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.130
with him.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.490
There was no choice.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.850
Were you

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.890
in the car that night?

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.770
I was in the car that night.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:09.490
What happened

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.770
inside the car?

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.460
All of us drank a lot

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.340
at the gathering that night.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.340
However, Sibei was drunk.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.610
I helped her get in the car.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.610
However, she was already

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.490
talking drunk
before she got in the car.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.460
What did she say?

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.650
She was upset

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.340
and wanted us to be good.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.850
She wouldn't
say something like that usually.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.460
Perhaps she was in a bad mood

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.100
so she drank a lot that day.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.490
How do you see Fan Jiancheng?

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.890
Mr. Fan is very nice.

00:16:35.977 --> 00:16:37.650
No matter which employee is in trouble,

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.010
he will also provide some help.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.955
Previously, Ye Sibei
needed proof of income.

00:16:40.977 --> 00:16:43.244
She wanted her income
to be higher in the statement.

00:16:43.288 --> 00:16:45.644
Mr. Fan signed it for her
without saying anything.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.850
In your memory,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.100
how much

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.890
did Ye Sibei drink that night?

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.250
Ms. Ye probably drank

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.770
more than 10 glasses that night.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.650
Do you remember
if Ye Sibei attended many gatherings

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.340
like the one on 9th April?

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.490
Not many.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.309
She doesn't attend these gatherings much

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.400
and she is inexperienced
in these drinking gatherings.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.090
She doesn't usually drink.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.700
(Guoqiang: Sibei,
how did you suffer this?)

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.980
(Chen Xiaoyang: Sibei,
what will you do in the future?)

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.100
(Do your best and believe in yourself)

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.740
(Li Xiaojuan: How did this happen?
I pity you.)

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.900
(Wang: Sibei, I pity you.
You must stay strong.)

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.780
Sibei.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.500
Have you eaten?

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.090
I made you some food.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.050
No need, thank you.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.050
I don't feel like eating.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.090
All right.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.250
The police
must be investigating the case today.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.940
They questioned many people.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.460
Everyone knows about it now.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.060
What happened next?

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.050
Then, many people called me

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.620
and sent text messages to comfort me.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.090
They asked me not to take it to heart

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.810
and said I was pitiful.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.770
They asked me
what I would do in the future.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.620
What does my future

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.120
have to do

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.420
with this?

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.733
What does it have to do
with your future?

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.250
It didn't at first.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.420
Because of them,

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.660
it has something to do now.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.090
However, they did it out of kindness.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.170
I understand.

00:19:10.311 --> 00:19:11.800
Let me bring you to a place.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:27.900
Give me your hands.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:31.620
Spread your fingers.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.050
When I first finished high school,

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.500
I had a hard time.

00:19:44.044 --> 00:19:45.220
My salary was low as well.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.140
I faced many problems.

00:19:47.244 --> 00:19:49.330
The seniors would always bully
new employees like me.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.860
I was small

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.300
and thin.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.010
I came back

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.266
and did 200 push-ups every day

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.770
to make myself stronger.

00:19:58.466 --> 00:20:00.010
Later, I fell in love with boxing,

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.140
so I learned how to box

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.330
on the internet.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.220
Pinch it.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.060
See if it's tight.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.740
It's tight.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:57.780
Give me a right jab.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.490
Remember.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:00.860
When you do a right jab,

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.010
you don't just use your arms.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.380
You generate power
with your waist and hips too.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.730
Will I hurt you?

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.770
If you hurt me,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.140
I'll buy you a meal.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.050
Try it again.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.020
Right jab.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.090
Duck.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.140
Left, right, duck.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.810
Right, left, duck.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.490
Left, right, duck.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.140
Right, left, knee.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.300
Right, left.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:23.610
Left.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.530
Are you exhausted?

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:07.980
It's my fault.

00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:10.777
I forgot you just got discharged
from the hospital.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.980
Sorry.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.860
Are you tired?

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.980
Give me your hand.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.250
Do you come here often to box?

00:22:33.422 --> 00:22:34.500
I don't feel so annoyed

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:35.980
after moving around.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.500
Do you regret not finishing high school?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.555
There's nothing to regret about.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.900
It'd only be a waste of money

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.000
if I had kept studying.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.330
It'd be better to drop out and work

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.355
so I could make money.

00:22:49.355 --> 00:22:50.480
Now, I'm living a good life,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.320
and that's enough.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.090
What else do you like?

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.140
I like to watch movies,

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.530
read novels,

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:57.890
and cook.

00:22:57.955 --> 00:22:59.466
You're not lying to me, are you?

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.090
Ye Sibei,

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.330
you don't really
care about who you marry.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.180
A guy who graduated from high school

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.090
with nothing

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:09.900
and only likes to drink and box.

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.900
Why do you want
to marry someone like that?

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.250
Aren't you the same?

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:15.700
I had no job.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:17.660
I was introverted and looked ordinary.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.929
I also had a younger brother.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.459
I also asked for a high betrothal gift.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.140
Why did you marry me?

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.380
You are a university graduate.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.700
You are also the boss of a workshop.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.090
Actually, I was excellent back then.

00:23:38.422 --> 00:23:40.222
Unfortunately, you didn't see that.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.330
I was the literary scholar
of our school.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.700
Which high school were you in?

00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:52.400
I was from the Seventh High School.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.090
What a pity.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.980
I was in the class of '06
from Second High School.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.530
If you studied in my school,

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.090
I'm sure you'd heard my name before.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.530
I was always
one of the top students in my year.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.660
You're amazing.

00:24:06.088 --> 00:24:07.800
Why didn't
a university graduate like you

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.700
stay in the provincial capital?

00:24:11.844 --> 00:24:13.090
I couldn't survive, I guess.

00:24:13.533 --> 00:24:16.377
There were many university graduates
who shared the same major as I.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.660
When I finally
found a job that suited me,

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.090
my mother messed it up.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.660
I rented a house
and got scammed by the agent.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.810
I encountered
many unfortunate incidents.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.730
I immediately felt

00:24:29.244 --> 00:24:31.420
that even though
my parents were always scolding me

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.810
and asking me for money,

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.810
that was still my home after all.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.260
When I came back,

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.066
I'd have a place to stay at least.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.700
But after you came back,

00:24:41.844 --> 00:24:43.420
your life didn't change for the better.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.090
Yes.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.620
I was always thinking about this.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.290
If my parents treated me badly

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.900
or if Nianwen were a very bad child,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.740
it would be better.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.140
However, Nianwen will fight for me,

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.420
and my parents are worried about me.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.050
They gave me a little bit of love,

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.660
but it isn't much.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.660
They brought me back to this swamp

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.980
so I would sink slowly.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.380
I drowned.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.620
I cannot escape from it

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.330
even if I want to.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.810
How so?

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.250
Walk out of this door,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.380
go down the stairs,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.220
get in the car,

00:25:28.266 --> 00:25:29.730
and drive to the provincial capital.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.410
Three hours on the highway.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.290
It's not that simple.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.900
It's that simple.

00:25:35.977 --> 00:25:37.170
Do you want to leave?

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.540
Now?

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.220
Now.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.700
How long have you

00:25:53.755 --> 00:25:54.810
had your driving license?

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.290
Don't speak to me.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.090
I'm nervous.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:57.930
All right.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.290
Should I drive instead?

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.050
No.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.940
I want to drive.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.530
You can drive,

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.460
but remember one thing.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.620
What is it?

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.240
Driving on the highway at a speed
of less than 60 kilometers per hour

00:26:14.244 --> 00:26:14.930
is illegal.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.330
You're awake?

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.620
Enjoying the sea breeze alone?

00:28:20.577 --> 00:28:22.444
Aren't we going
to the provincial capital?

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.980
Why are we here?

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.090
I think I took the wrong highway exit.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.140
So, I decided to keep driving

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.700
without looking at the road signs

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.050
until I couldn't drive anymore

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:32.900
and stopped there.

00:28:33.755 --> 00:28:35.090
You couldn't drive anymore?

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.860
It ran out of petrol.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.180
I can fix the car if it is broken.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.644
If the car ran out of petrol,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.620
there's nothing I can do to help.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:50.940
What should I do?

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.620
Find a petrol station.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:55.930
Let's go.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.380
You should fuel yourself.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:10.940
Tell me about yourself
when you were a child.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.700
It's boring.

00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:17.700
I want to hear about it.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.980
I don't remember my parents much.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.730
They always worked outside

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.955
and didn't come home much.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.330
I lived with my brother
and my grandfather.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.660
My brother and I

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.330
are considered left-behind children.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.700
The elder kids in the village
often bullied me.

00:29:40.733 --> 00:29:42.533
My brother was the only one
who protected me.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:44.940
As far as I can remember,

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.660
my brother always had
new injuries on his face.

00:29:48.511 --> 00:29:49.900
The injuries never seemed to heal.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.420
Back then, he always told me

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.980
life was very pointless.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.700
I was still young

00:29:58.111 --> 00:30:00.460
and didn't know how he felt
when he said those words.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.060
Bei...

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.330
Stay away!

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:10.810
I'm scared.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.940
Mom, can you not leave?

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:20.730
Mom.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.970
I have to work in the city

00:30:23.266 --> 00:30:25.311
so I can make enough money
to raise both of you.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.010
Qin Bei,

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.900
take good care of your brother.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.530
Dad, I'm leaving.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.040
Mom, don't go!

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.120
Don't follow me.

00:30:44.577 --> 00:30:45.688
Be a good boy at home.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.770
Mom!

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.220
Mom!

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.660
Do you know how I overcame the days

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.660
when I got bullied?

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.380
If they made me upset,

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.770
I'd scold them.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.250
When I feel like scolding someone,

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.490
you must advise me.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.290
Why?

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.220
Advise me to give them an earful.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:35.860
Why don't you

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.330
practice scolding at the sea?

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.010
Jerk!

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.140
You are too polite.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:56.530
Jerk!

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:57.700
Scum!

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.090
So disgusting!

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:00.660
Not enough!

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.500
Continue!

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.490
Despicable! Shameless! Pervert!

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:05.810
Thick-faced!

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.090
Shameless!

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:08.290
Hooligan!

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.290
Pervert!

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.490
Jerk!

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:11.380
Scum!

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.290
Shameless!

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.140
Did I not show you any respect?

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.180
Jerk!

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.380
Scum!

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.370
Sibei,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.700
when we win the court case,

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.620
let's sell our house in Nancheng

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.330
and live here.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.140
Officers.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.210
I've been in here for a long time.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.610
When are you going to question me?

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.130
Look.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.780
I fell asleep twice

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.300
and drank about eight cups of water.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:21.900
I'm a good person.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.210
I'm really a good person.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:26.210
If you don't question me,

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.940
how do you know
if I'm a good or a bad person?

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.210
Quiet. Why are you making noise?

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.860
I'm not.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.740
I've been staying here

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.130
without making any complaints.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.820
However,
you made me stay here for so long

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.022
without questioning me.

00:34:35.022 --> 00:34:36.311
Why are you keeping me here?

00:34:36.377 --> 00:34:37.866
If you don't plan to question me,

00:34:37.888 --> 00:34:39.666
just let me go home
and this will be over.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.650
Why don't we go outside?

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.300
Let's have a chat outside, Officers!

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.210
Don't just write things down.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.780
Say something.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.620
Officers.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.860
Officers.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.100
Quiet.

00:34:52.888 --> 00:34:54.466
Whether you are a good person or not,

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.490
you can talk to Captain Zhang
when he's here.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.530
Captain Zhang!

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:00.940
Captain Zhang, where are you?

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.090
Captain Zhang, show yourself.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.530
You...

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.490
You brought me here.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:08.900
Captain Zhang!

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:10.330
Quiet.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.820
I can't!

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:17.380
(Jiangbian Hotel)

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.370
Sibei.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.090
I'm downstairs.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.490
If you are free,

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.940
let's have a chat.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.700
Sibei.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:38.610
I'm here to visit you.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.090
I asked someone

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.900
to send me these from our hometown,

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.340
especially for you.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.860
I don't know how you have been

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.460
after you left the company.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.380
If you are in trouble,

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.260
you must tell me.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:49.650
Here. Take them.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.490
No need.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.130
I'm sure you are not here for this.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:01.690
We've been working together

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.090
for so long.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.210
I'll be blunt.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.780
Actually,

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.610
Mr. Fan is a decent guy

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.090
and he treated you well.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.050
You might not know this.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:15.610
When you first joined the company,

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.460
the HR department disagreed.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.530
It was Mr. Fan who protected you.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:20.370
Ms. Tao,

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.130
what are you trying to say?

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.620
It's nothing.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.820
I don't know

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.090
what happened between you

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.010
and Mr. Fan.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.260
However, I want to advise you

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.420
to forgive whenever you can.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:36.530
Well,

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.900
everything can be settled in private.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:39.610
There's no need

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.380
to put him in jail, right?

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.090
Moreover, if this blows up,

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.355
no one will benefit from this.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:45.800
It looks bad for the company

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.690
and you'll be ashamed.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.050
Even if you don't think about yourself,

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.740
you have to think about your parents.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.090
If news of this were to spread,

00:36:54.911 --> 00:36:56.490
how would people look at your husband?

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.100
Chuchu as well.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.610
If you don't spare Mr. Fan,

00:36:59.711 --> 00:37:01.977
do you think
she can still work for the company?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.130
There's also your parents.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.220
What else?

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.690
What else can you use to threaten me?

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:11.490
I'm saying this for your own good.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.740
How am I threatening you?

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.690
Thank you.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.460
I'm not close to you.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.022
There's no need to be so nice to me.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.130
Once a criminal case is opened,

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:23.088
I can't decide
whether the case can be dropped.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.090
Don't come to me for this
again in the future.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:25.930
It's no use.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.780
Sibei.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.090
Sibei.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.820
I'm not leaving tonight.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:03.930
Sure.

00:38:10.933 --> 00:38:12.140
Where should I sleep?

00:38:16.244 --> 00:38:18.130
If I sleep on the bed,
you might be nervous.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.980
If I sleep on the floor,

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:21.460
you might overthink.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.090
Where do you want to sleep?

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.900
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.980
Why?

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.380
I'm fine with sleeping on the floor.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.650
I like to sleep on hard surfaces.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.460
Qin Nan,

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.090
before we got married,

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:34.980
were you in a relationship before?

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.380
No.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.900
Did you have someone you liked a lot?

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.460
I'm not sure if I liked her or not.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.860
However, there's someone

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.820
whom I've hoped could live well.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.780
I've never thought about being with her

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.340
but I've always hoped
for her to live a good life.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.340
(Forensic Examination Report)

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.180
Master.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:17.370
Master.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.090
Here's the forensic examination report.

00:40:19.111 --> 00:40:21.300
The skin tissue collected
from Ye Sibei's fingernails

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.260
matches Fan Jiancheng's DNA.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.380
Fan Jiancheng thought
he could lie his way out.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.900
Let's see what else he has to say now.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.780
Thankfully, we applied
for extended custody in time.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.620
Let's go.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.700
We'll question him.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.610
The biological sample
collected from Ye Sibei's body

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.300
matches your DNA.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.300
Fan Jiancheng!

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:45.650
How do you explain this?

00:40:58.530 --> 00:40:59.610
It's all my fault.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.650
I couldn't hold back.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.380
She wanted to have sex with me.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.260
What?

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.460
She was the one
who wanted to have sex with me.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.690
Ye Sibei wanted to have sex with you?

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.050
How?

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.980
Didn't I tell you before?

00:41:26.088 --> 00:41:27.622
I said her husband had always thought

00:41:27.622 --> 00:41:28.940
there was something between us.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.780
There was really nothing at first.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:32.420
That day,

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:34.650
after I sent Chuchu home,

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:36.900
I wanted to send her home.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.460
On our way, she told me

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.780
she was not happy

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.090
and said her husband treated her badly.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.610
She said she wanted

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:47.900
to go out with me

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.010
and get some fresh air.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.940
So, I drove
to the rapeseed flower field.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.650
When we were there,

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.050
she said she liked me.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.210
Then, she had sex with me.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:02.340
During the process,

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.860
was Ye Sibei drunk

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.090
or sober?

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.690
Of course, she was sober.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.650
After that, she even asked me

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:12.210
for 100,000 yuan.

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.490
I was so angry

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.610
and wondered what it would be
if I had paid her.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.010
I chased her out of the car

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.690
and drove away on my own.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.260
I didn't expect her

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.090
to look for me the next day.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:26.900
She said she would make a police report

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.860
if I didn't pay her.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.380
I figured I didn't do anything wrong

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.010
so I wasn't afraid.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.650
Later, she told me

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:35.130
she would not drop the case

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:36.460
if I didn't pay her.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:39.260
After that, all of you came.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.530
Why didn't you tell us before this?

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.980
Officer Lin,

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.420
both of us have our own families.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.380
It is embarrassing

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.820
to say this.

00:42:53.866 --> 00:42:56.090
I'm just trying to hide it
for as long as possible.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:56.940
Right?

00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.300
Fan Jiancheng,

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.900
we have solid evidence now.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.610
Are you still denying this?

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.711
Have you even
told us one true statement?

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.422
Everything I said was true.

00:43:07.422 --> 00:43:08.866
If you don't believe me, get her here,

00:43:08.888 --> 00:43:10.244
and we can confront each other.
