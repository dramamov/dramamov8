00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.480
Let me do it.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.599
Mom, let me go out.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.079
Mom.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.000
Why should I let you out?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.199
Running around outside again.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.360
You think you're grown up now.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.599
Staying out late at night.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.599
Hanging out with those shady people

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.879
and messing around outside.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:23.599
Yesterday...

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.360
If it weren't for—

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.479
your Uncle Jia bringing you home,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.599
who knows what trouble you'd get into.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.800
Mom, listen to me.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.759
I met Meng Yan.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.759
He's still alive.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.360
Meng Yan is alive.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.759
He’s really lucky.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:40.960
He told Sister Yue'er

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.719
that on the night his family was attacked,

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.360
he heard Shen Tianyi’s voice.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.120
Just like Sister Yue'er said.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.879
Shen Tianyi is—

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.680
Enough!

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.319
The older you get, the less respect you have.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.199
Call him Uncle Shen.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.759
When Uncle Jia brought me home,

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.960
did you see Meng Yan?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560
Jin Zhenghao took Meng Xiaoduo away.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800
We went to look for him.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.560
But Jin Zhenghao tried to kill us.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.319
Then I passed out.

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.080
Did Uncle Jia save Meng Yan too?

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.479
I only care if you’re safe.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.599
I don’t have time for anyone else.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.520
Mom.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.800
What happened to Meng Yan?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.159
Mom.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.000
Please, I’m begging you.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.719
Let me go out.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.319
I want to see him.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.080
After all these years,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.319
you still can't let him go.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.599
Yes.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.080
I’ve looked into that person.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.800
He does look a bit like Meng Yan.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.159
But the Meng family was wiped out six years ago.

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.560
Meng Yan is already dead.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.360
No, Mom—

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.560
He really is Meng Yan.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.919
He can read minds.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.680
That’s the Meng family’s Psychic Perception.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.360
Mind reading? Really?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.360
That’s just a cheap street trick.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.319
Stop trying.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.560
You can’t open it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.319
With your little skills,

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.199
Others may not know,

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.079
but I’m your mother, I know.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.959
Stay home and reflect.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680
Without my permission,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.000
no one is allowed to let her out.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.279
Yes, Madam.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.560
Yan’er.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360
Yan’er.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.680
Where is this place?

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:05.360
This is the Heart Realm.

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:07.759
It’s the true secret of our Meng family’s

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.480
Psychic Perception.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.759
When you enter the Heart Realm,

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.360
the true power of Psychic Perception

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.160
will be unlocked.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:23.800
Dad.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:25.959
Mom.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.560
Why are you both soaking wet?

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.920
Have you been standing in the rain?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.480
It rains in this world too.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:38.399
When Yan’er feels sad,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.000
clouds gather here.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.759
When you’re deeply sad,

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.000
it rains here.

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.399
There’s nothing here.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.319
You must be lonely.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.560
Every parent wants

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.319
to always be with their child.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.680
When something goes wrong,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.560
to help them right away.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.800
That’s a parent’s duty.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.399
Loneliness isn’t scary.

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:04.800
What’s scary is rain that never stops.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:08.360
Can you stay here?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.600
Don’t leave me again.

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:12.319
Yan’er.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.360
We are the source

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.959
of the power within you.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.079
We are your parents,

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:21.759
and yet not your parents.

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.480
What do you mean?

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.600
I don’t understand.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.519
This place

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.560
is hidden inside your heart,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.160
a place for cultivation.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.160
Other psychics

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.399
can only gain power from jade spirit stones.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.600
That’s how they get their energy.

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.800
And use it to strengthen their abilities.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.480
But we

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:44.600
grow stronger

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.560
by increasing our mental strength.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.279
That’s how we gain power.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:51.319
True breakthroughs in mental strength

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.319
happen in the emotional void.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.160
When emotions surge,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.680
breaking through all barriers,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.199
the heart can be opened.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:05.199
So I can get stronger here?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.959
Remember,

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.759
the Heart Realm’s entropy tide

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.959
can wash away your confusion,

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.319
giving you greater mental power.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.560
What are you doing?

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.959
What are you doing?

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:45.240
Me?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800
I didn’t do anything.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.480
You didn’t do anything?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.600
How did you know what I said?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.079
I didn’t do anything, so I don’t know.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.639
What do you mean by “doing something”?

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.680
Jia Yaozu.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.639
Don’t pull.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.000
Don’t pull.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.800
Can you stop tugging me?

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.040
I’m only on this floor.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.879
Miss.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.319
Where’s Jia Yaozu?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.800
The Madam is in the living room.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.319
What are you laughing at?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480
Congratulations, Miss.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:19.959
Congratulations for what?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.439
Oh.

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.959
Nothing.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.279
Son-in-law

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.199
What do you mean?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.200
If you prefer, I can call you son-in-law.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.200
You—

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.960
Stop wasting words with her.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:38.879
Be gentle.

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:39.720
Can you stop pulling?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.960
I only have this layer on.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.000
Weren't you hurt?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.759
How are you still so energetic?

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:44.200
Even Jia Yaozu can't heal this wound.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.000
I'll stab him to death.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.879
Jia Yaozu

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.000
Are you done yet?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.759
Hey.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.120
Slow down.

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.159
Jia Yaozu

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:57.399
You're awake.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.200
Why are you two just getting up?

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:02.279
Fighting without even getting dressed.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:03.799
What nonsense are you saying?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.399
Look at what you've done.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:08.919
Oh, no need to thank me.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.200
This is what your uncle should do.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:13.320
I still—

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.480
Thank you.

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:17.240
Hey.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.080
You—

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:21.519
Didn't you just say—

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.960
I did a good thing?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.240
You're a real scoundrel.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.080
Hey.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.120
I'm definitely not the scoundrel here.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.720
Last night—

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:36.399
Shut up.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.080
Drinking first thing in the morning.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.399
You've drunk your brain silly.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.200
Early in the morning—

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:45.080
Look, it's almost afternoon.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.759
You can really sleep.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.279
Must be exhausted.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:50.919
Shut up.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.480
Afternoon.

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:54.600
Where's Xiaoduo?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.360
Where is Xiaoduo?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.799
Your wife won't let me talk.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.679
Who's his wife?

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:07.639
What kind of uncle are you?

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.399
Oh!

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.759
So you do know I'm your uncle.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.879
Where exactly is Xiaoduo?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.080
Oh.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.600
That little girl?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.440
She slept all day, just like you.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.759
Such a little kid, and she snores.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.000
Why are we at your place?

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.440
What do you mean, your place or mine?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.600
Your uncle's house is your home too.

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:38.759
And also—

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:40.240
Last night, you two—

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.240
What exactly did you do?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.960
Drank too much.

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:45.600
Got into a fight.

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:48.399
You think everyone's like you?

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.799
Drunkard.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.600
It's not like your uncle forbids you to drink.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.000
Why are you so angry?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.720
Next time you drink, invite me.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:57.080
I'll set it up for you.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.200
Tell me your type in advance.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.480
I'll arrange a few for you.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720
We're all men here.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.639
We all get it.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:07.679
I'm injured,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.600
not deaf.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.600
You think everyone's like you?

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:14.799
See?

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.399
Now you're siding with outsiders.

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.399
I just see Meng Yan as family.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960
That's why I said that.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.360
Enough, I don't want to argue.

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:24.399
Let's go.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.159
Wait.

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:33.519
Did I tell you he's Meng Yan?

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.360
You did.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.399
You didn't.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.279
Did I or didn't I?

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.200
Whether you did or not—

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.559
I know anyway.

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:52.799
Stop trying.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.799
That trick doesn't work on me.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:59.200
You're just giving yourself away.

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:01.600
Other than the Meng family,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.919
who else could use this?

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:07.679
Miss, the Azure Dragon Gang—

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.120
Damn, let's go!

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:12.600
What's wrong?

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.759
Something happened to the Azure Dragon Gang.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.279
Big brother.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.600
Your daughter—

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:30.559
is getting more and more troublesome.
