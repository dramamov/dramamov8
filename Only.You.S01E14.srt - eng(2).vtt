00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
We suspect she has a kidney condition.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.960
Please tell me the truth.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.720
Is this your way of forcing me
to accept you,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.600
even as Songklod's daughter?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.320
Please just give me the chance
to see them one more time.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.200
Are you sure you can handle this, Ayla?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.880
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.560
I don't know
if this will be the last time we meet.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.480
Slowly.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.800
The number you have dialed
cannot be connected at this time.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.760
Dad.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.160
Ayla, are you hungry?

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.080
I'll have Kate prepare something for you.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.440
Dad.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.240
Can you tell me the truth about Tawan?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.840
Kate, bring me the envelope.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.240
AGREEMENT OF DIVORCE

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.120
SIGN
MS. RAWEE CHOKPRASERTSAP

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.680
Dad!

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.200
What's this divorce paper?

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.600
It just needs your signature.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.000
Once signed,
the divorce will be legally valid.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.200
I don't understand. Why, Dad?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.560
Why let me be so happy marrying her,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.800
only to turn around and force a divorce?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.120
What is this?

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.640
I didn't force Tawan.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.200
All of it was her decision.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.880
That's not true.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.040
I've got a new kidney now.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.400
I'm about to have a new, better life.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.320
Why would she want a divorce?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.640
Or did you make
some kind of deal with her?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.760
Or…

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.800
The one who donated me a kidney…

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.520
was Tawan?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.760
Yes.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.040
The test showed you two were a match.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.880
But the condition was,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.720
if you weren't siblings,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.400
you had to be married.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.160
So, that's why you let us
register our marriage?

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.760
Yes.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.680
Then you still haven't forgiven
her father, have you?

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.160
That's right.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.440
And during recovery, where was she?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.400
In the room next door.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.120
But once she was strong enough,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.080
Tawan flew back to Thailand before us.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.600
And now? Where is she?

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.920
I don't know, my girl.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.920
I don't know where she is.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.920
YOU'D REALLY LEAVE WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.840
SEND

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.600
HOW COULD YOU BE SO CRUEL TO ME?

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.360
AND WHEN I FINALLY EMAILED YOU

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.120
YOU DIDN'T EVEN REPLY

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.000
TAWAN RAWEE - NO SUBJECT

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.720
YOU'VE GOT AN EMAIL

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.920
LIVE A HAPPY LIFE
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF, MY LOVE

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.680
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.040
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.120
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.120
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.120
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.720
MAYBE YOU FORGOT…

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.200
YOU DISAPPEARED FOR EIGHT YEARS
BUT I STILL FOUND YOU

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.720
FROM A SINGLE PHOTO

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.160
IN A NEWSPAPER

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.039
Stay calm.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.400
A bodyguard's girlfriend has to stay calm.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.800
Listen.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.800
No matter where you are,
I'll find you.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.880
Even if my body can't take it,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.400
I'll make it strong enough to go to you.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.840
Even if it takes years,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.840
I'll keep searching until I do.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.440
My love.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.400
You're okay, right?

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.840
I'm okay.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.360
Dressed like this, where are you going?

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.960
I'm about to use a right I have.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.440
Since talking nicely doesn't work,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.200
I guess it's time to make a statement.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.800
So, which plan
are we going with in the meeting?

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.760
Yeah. Which one?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.240
Well…

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.720
-Ms. Ayla.
-Ms. Ayla.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.360
What do we do?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.320
Hello, everyone.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.480
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.200
How are you doing, Lady Boss?

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.240
I came to see Tawan.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.440
Boss isn't here.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.000
Not here?

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.720
That's right.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.280
And no one knows where she went.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.040
No one knows?

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.040
No one?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.480
Not a single person?

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.400
But didn't Boss say
she'd already signed the divorce papers?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.440
‎MARRIAGE LICENSE

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.240
Or maybe Lady Boss refused to sign?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.960
Yeah, that's what I was wondering too.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.480
No need to wonder.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.360
I haven't signed them.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.560
Which means I'm still married to Tawan.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.720
And this marriage license

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.480
proves I'm her lawful spouse.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.720
That also means

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.000
I have legal rights
to every asset your boss owns.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.720
So,

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.440
are you ready to tell me where she is?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.560
Well?

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.480
If you won't tell me,

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.440
I'll use my rights
to make changes to this company.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.200
Huh?

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.600
-Change the company?
-Change the company?

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.120
That's right.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.320
I'll change the company.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.720
And no one's allowed to resign.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.880
-What?
-What?

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.600
I mean what I say.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.200
-Is she really doing that?
-Oh no.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.880
Hello, Attorney? I have something
I'd like to consult you about.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.840
-Wait!
-We know!

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.120
-We know where Boss is right now.
-Take it easy!

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.760
Please, hang up first.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.840
We can talk this through.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.600
Oh, sorry, Attorney. Wrong number.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.120
Wrong number. Perfect.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.920
Out with it. I'm busy.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.120
I asked you here today…

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.760
because I want to apologize.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.040
For everything
I did wrong to you and Ayla.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.400
For letting my greed

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.400
destroy the trust you once had in me.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.120
I'm truly sorry.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.680
I don't know

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.440
if it's too late

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.360
for forgiveness.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.640
If you still can't forgive me,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.080
I don't know what to do anymore.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.040
But when I think of Tawan and Ayla,
they love each other so much,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.600
and society accepts them with no problems.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.840
It's only us, their fathers,
standing in their way.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.400
I can't bear to see them suffer.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.480
They're good kids.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.920
They don't deserve hardship anymore.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.960
If I try to be a better father now…

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.280
a father who puts his children first…

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.520
Can I still be that, my friend?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.480
Realizing late is still better than never.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.720
Fine.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.000
I'll forgive you.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.000
But not because of your long,
rambling speech.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.040
It's because of Tawan.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.560
She's better than her father ever was.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.840
Thank you, my friend. Truly.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.120
Don't get all sentimental.
Gives me goosebumps!

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.160
Why would you do this to me?

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.640
Why would you?

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.280
Hm?

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.280
I'm sorry.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.960
Don't cry.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.520
You got hurt because of me again.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.640
Why go this far?

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.360
For you, Ayla…

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.800
I'd give my whole life.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.320
You said that,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.120
yet you left me all alone.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.200
Do you know what it felt like
when I saw those divorce papers?

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.960
It was like the new body,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.200
the new life I was about to have,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.080
went completely numb.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.320
Numb to everything,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.760
except pain,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.400
grief,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.840
and confusion.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.920
But you know what?

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.280
This body carries a part of you.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.520
That's why I forced myself to be strong…

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.880
so I could find you.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.480
Thank you…

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.240
for being strong,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.840
for taking such good care of yourself.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.720
I'm sorry

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.880
I had to do this.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.560
It was a promise I made to Mr. Thana.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.400
And I had to keep it.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.240
But shouldn't you have talked to me first?

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.720
And if I had,

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.720
would you have accepted my kidney?

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.160
No!

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.400
Don't cry, Ayla.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.000
Ayla.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.960
Do you know
how devastated I would've been

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.560
if you hadn't accepted it?

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.400
But now you only have one kidney left.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.640
Your body will never be the same.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.440
Your life will never be the same.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.040
That doesn't matter.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.000
You can live the rest of life for me.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.280
No.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.080
I won't live for you.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.320
We'll live the rest of it together.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.960
What's up, sweetheart?

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.560
Dad.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.360
I need to tell you something.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.200
I'm with Tawan now.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.680
And…

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.680
she never contacted me.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.800
She even ran away so far,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.520
but I still found her.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.800
So, she hasn't broken any promise to you.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.080
And one more thing.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.880
I will never divorce Tawan.
No matter what happens.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.600
Good. Don't divorce. Leave it at that.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.680
Everything's been settled on this side.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.280
-Dad!
-Dad!

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.080
Once you're rested, hurry back.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.840
Things are busy here.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.320
The companies might be merging soon.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.280
Bye.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.600
Bye, girls.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.000
Bye.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.800
-Hello.
-Hi, Ayla.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.560
Hurry, get your makeup done.
Boss has asked for you several times.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.200
Why? What's going on?

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.840
There's an important client
she wants to introduce you to.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.800
A client?

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.000
Looks like a major sponsor.
Boss herself came to welcome her.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.520
Right.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.680
She usually avoids showing up herself.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.680
Ayla! Finally! Go get makeup done.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.680
Maybe you'll have time
for one more soundcheck.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.520
But I'm not late today.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600
I even came early.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.040
I know. You're never late,
always punctual.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.920
But we need to be extra ready.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.360
But first,
are you sure you're up for this?

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.400
I'm sure.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.320
Because if not, tell me right away.
I've prepared another version of the set.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.000
Cut the dancing, no fast songs.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.520
Just ballads

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.520
and a little talk with the fans.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.160
Boss, no need to cut it down more.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.440
There's not much dancing left anyway.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.440
If you cut more than this,
it won't be a concert anymore.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.040
You're sure?

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.280
I'm sure.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.920
She can handle it.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.960
Alright then.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.120
If you're sure, go get your makeup done.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.160
Okay.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.280
Boss, the client has arrived.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.040
Hello, hello!

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.600
-So glad you made it!
-Missed you.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.480
Missed you too.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.920
You didn't get lost, did you?
Thought you'd lose your way.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.800
Of course not. I had the GPS guide me.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.400
I thought you'd say
you let love guide the way.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.600
Oh, Ayla, Tawan.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.160
This is my friend, Khun.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.200
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.960
Hello, and congratulations.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.200
Thank you so much, Khun.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.280
These are beautiful.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.600
Khun here is going to be
the main sponsor for Ayla.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.360
Maybe even for all our artists.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.800
-That big?
-Mhm.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.680
Maybe I'll take over the whole company.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.760
Whoa, take over BEC Music?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.480
No need for that.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.400
Because what's mine is already yours.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.560
Come on. I'll show you around.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.080
You asked me that
And I don't quite get why

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.640
Asked how I feel when you pass me by

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.440
You said things that made me go wild

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.760
You think I'm here to play for a while?

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.320
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I really like you

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.080
Boy, I think of you all the time
And yeah, I'm sure

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.120
No need to wonder anymore

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.600
Everyone says you're the one I adore

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.600
Mom says you're sweet

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.640
Dad says you're kind

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.480
My big sis said
That one's the perfect find

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.120
You take care of me without a break

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.280
How could I not fall?

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.880
Because everything about you
Checks, checks, checks every box

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.800
Hi.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.680
Is that your girlfriend? She's gorgeous.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.000
No, just a close friend.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.360
Why? Does it look like something more?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.720
Way more. You look more like a couple.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.040
No wonder.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.160
Wherever we go,
people always give us strange looks.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.000
And do you care what they think?

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.920
No. We're not doing anything wrong.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.760
Ayla, remember what I told you?

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.040
When you love someone with all your heart,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.800
love them unconditionally,

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.400
sometimes there's no reason for it,

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.000
no right or wrong.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.120
I remember.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.080
And sometimes, it doesn't need a label.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.480
No definitions.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.560
Just the heart.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.560
And it's up to us
what we want to call that love.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.960
So, you're fine
with people calling it "friendship"?

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.200
Yes. "Friend" is the best word of all.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.520
There's no breaking up.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.840
Only a beautiful,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.560
steady, lasting bond.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.960
But being lovers

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.800
can be steady and lasting too.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.000
True.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.440
It depends which word means more to you.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:47.320
Checks, checks, checks every box

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.720
Checks, checks, checks every box

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.760
Wish you be happy,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.200
surrounded by the people who love you.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.040
Thank you.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.680
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.880
You better know, the one you're looking at

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.200
Won't just fall for your magic like that

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:30.240
You better know, I'm a superstar

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:36.040
If you wanna try
You'll have to wait in line…

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.160
Only you

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.160
Don't mean to scare you

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.040
Will love you so

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.720
You've gotta play by the rules

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.440
If you wanna join
I won't be your little toy

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.080
You've only got one choice

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.160
Just me, just me, just me

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.760
You've gotta take care of me all the time

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.200
Sometimes you've gotta be around
Don't let me get all pouty now

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.160
When I look at you
It's written all over my eyes

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.960
I'm waiting for the day you'd look my way

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.600
I scream inside my heart every day

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.560
But somehow, it never reaches you

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.640
I want you to know
No matter how long I keep it inside

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.880
Do you even realize
My whole heart is yours?

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.000
And every single moment

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.840
I long to say this word, love
More than you could ever know

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:17.680
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.360
Time to wake up.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.320
I don't want to.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.640
I'm the moon that wakes up late.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.760
The sun rises too early.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.600
Come on. Wake up.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.840
We've got an important appointment today.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.520
We need to get dressed.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.600
No, I'm not getting up.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.360
Not yet.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.160
One, two…

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.960
three!

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.199
Oh, you're here already.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.880
Hey! Who cuts pork like that?

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.480
What's wrong with it? I cut it this way.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.920
Ayla likes it. What about you?

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.280
Did you wash the vegetables properly?
How many minutes?

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.840
Ten minutes, then let the water
run through for another five.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.560
Any longer,
and it'll be boiled salad by now.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.239
Dad,

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.480
what are you two doing?

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.520
-Cooking.
-Cooking.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.440
And where did you leave the note?

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.840
By the elevator.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.880
Use the kitchen as much as you want.
Practice a special dish.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.240
We'll be back to taste it.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.400
And won't our dads be mad?

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.440
Don't know.
Guess we'll have to sweet-talk them later.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.400
Hungry yet?
Chef Ayla will cook for you herself.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.800
Ayla,

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.520
wouldn't it be easier to just eat out?

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.560
You never let me play housewife for you.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.680
I just don't want you to get tired.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.680
Morning already.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.400
Shall we get up?

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.120
Today the sun wants to sleep in a little.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.600
The moon woke up far too early.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.720
Well then, if the sun's going to sleep in,

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.520
the moon's going to sneak a kiss!

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.520
Wake up. Wake up!

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.920
My love.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.360
Love you most.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.520
Ayla,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.400
go back inside.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.040
Sorry, we got lost.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.080
We were wondering,
which way to the main road?

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.160
This place is gorgeous.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.480
Yes.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.800
Yes, very.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.360
But this is a private road.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.880
If you drive through, it's a dead end.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.400
To reach the main road, just U-turn,
take a left, a right, and you'll be there.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.880
U-turn, left, right, then the main road…

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.000
Got it.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.160
Thank you so much.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.800
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.080
Those two women were cute.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.960
Pretty, too…

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.560
weren't they?

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.160
If I say "pretty",

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.720
I'm in trouble.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.280
If I say "not pretty",

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.760
I'm breaking the fourth precept, lying.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.600
The prettiest in the world is my girl.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.720
No one tops her.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.760
Here, let me put this on you.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.560
Thank you.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.120
It's so pretty.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.840
You know,

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.720
meeting, knowing,

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.440
falling in love,

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.520
it's not easy.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.640
At first,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.840
you just notice each other,

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.920
then start to like each other,

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.920
then slowly get attached.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.240
And before you realize it,

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.320
you're in love and don't know
how to love more than this.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.080
Thank you

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.640
for being born for me to love.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.280
From this moment on,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.680
we'll live for each other.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.080
Tawan!

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.520
Promise?

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.800
Promise.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.720
Super pinky promise!

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.960
Super pinky promise.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.360
BODYGUARD

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.680
If I say I love you now,
would it still be in time?

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.880
My love.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.840
Love you most.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.600
