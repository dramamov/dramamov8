00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.370
(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.070
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.510
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.510
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.890
(My Youth)

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.930
How is he? How's Hae?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.199
Hae...

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400
He's still...

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.570
unconscious.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.110
Excuse me, what about his sister? Did you get a hold of her?

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.050
Seok Joo is on his way with her.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.989
You acted quickly, so there's no brain damage.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.060
He's currently breathing on his own.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.230
Oh, thank goodness.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.530
Thank you.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.029
He did hit his forehead when he fell.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.369
There was a lot of blood.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.530
We've treated it.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.840
And based on his last exam,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.640
he's not at the point where he needs a pacemaker just yet,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.940
but his condition is progressing a little on the faster side.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.010
We heard about a clinical trial.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.119
Is Hae eligible for it?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.720
Would it help him get better?

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.550
The patient's decision is important, so we'll discuss it when he's awake.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.390
Okay.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.230
Thank you.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.010
(Absolute rest)

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.800
How is he?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.230
- What? - Sir.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.200
Where's my brother?

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.799
Wait, what happened to my brother?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.499
What's wrong with him?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.309
Well, you know how your mom was sick...

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.110
But in his case, we were fortunate to catch it early.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.840
He's going to be okay. All right?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.750
We're just waiting for him to wake up.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.150
Once he's more stable,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.450
they said he should wake up soon.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.660
Hae... Oh, no...

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.560
My goodness. What do I do?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.169
What's going to happen to him?

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.270
- It's okay. - Je Yeon.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.569
Oh, what am I going to do?

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.939
Poor Hae. What do I do?

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.510
Don't worry.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.850
Gosh, Mr. Chan.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.869
I'm guessing you all haven't eaten yet?

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.980
I didn't know how many people would be here,

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.810
so I just packed whatever I could.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.950
Please eat something while it's still warm.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.250
Nu Ri must have been so scared.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.460
Thank you for bringing all this food.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.860
You went to a lot of trouble.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.560
I just felt like I had to do something.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.730
Nu Ri.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.210
You can go home now.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.410
You have work tomorrow, and there are plenty of people here.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080
Your son...

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.250
He must have lived a good life.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.990
He's clearly loved by so many.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.690
He is.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.060
If he didn't have a father like me, he would've had an even better life.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.030
Thanks for coming with me.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.770
Take care of yourself.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.440
Go on.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.850
(Final Episode)

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.870
Oh, Seok Joo.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.770
- Goodness. - What... How...

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.670
Like this?

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.180
Hey!

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.010
Nu Ri.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.680
Hey, what about school?

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.550
- You... - Is that really important now?

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.150
Seriously? What is this?

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.220
So this is what you had to tell me?

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.560
Is this why you told me to go to Mom's?

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.060
Is this what you meant when you said we couldn't live together anymore?

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.630
I have so much to yell at you about, so why did you have to get sick?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.299
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.569
Why are you sick? Why?

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.170
Why are you sick?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.140
Because telling you...

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.950
felt more painful than the sickness itself.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.660
Hae...

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.320
Why do you always try to handle everything on your own?

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.589
You know you can lean on me.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.760
Okay, okay.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.700
We're family.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.870
Oh, no...

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.280
Hey.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.180
Kim Seok Joo, stop crying!

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.549
You're supposed to be comforting me.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.850
You have to comfort me first! I've been holding it in too!

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.390
Hey, hey. Everyone.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.760
Hey, come over here. Come on.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.070
This is a hospital. We need to be quiet. You hear me?

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.740
Now that you've seen he's awake, you can all go.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.839
You, to school. You, to work.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.940
Go. Hurry up.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.580
- It's so loud, my goodness. - I'm not going.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.850
I'm going to stay by his side.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.450
I'm not going to work either.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.350
Nu Ri.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:02.750
Go to school...

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.960
and find that pen of mine, will you?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.590
It's not just any pen.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.930
I'll be checking to see that you're home.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.760
Now, go.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.570
Take Nu Ri with you. Hurry.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.800
Go.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.210
All right, I'm going.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.550
I have to get to work.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.090
I'll take Nu Ri with me.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360
Okay.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.490
Thanks.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.030
For what?

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.570
You must've wanted to see him first.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.670
Thanks for being so patient.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.980
I'll call you.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.150
Okay. I'm leaving now.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.239
The good thing is, we discovered it early.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.370
And you've been managing it well up to now.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.410
It's still early enough that we can explore our options.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.140
So I absolutely recommend you go.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.480
Getting a spot in a clinical trial isn't easy,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.380
and this is a race against time.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.360
So, please talk it over and let me know your decision.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.390
That must have been a huge shock.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.500
It was supposed to be our first Christmas date.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.130
And I ruined it.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.200
Don't feel sorry.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.870
To be honest, my family is Buddhist,

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.540
so it's okay.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.950
Your dad was probably more shocked than I was.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.690
He was here until a moment ago. He's just resting.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.420
Okay.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.400
I hope this doesn't leave a scar.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.810
Mr. Geon No waited all night, and then...

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.040
he figured you would yell at him if he didn't open the shop.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.810
So he went to the dawn market.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.280
He knows me well.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.250
Oh, but...

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.420
Did you have to call everyone?

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.260
I was afraid something might happen to you.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.530
I thought that might be the last time.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.970
I called everyone I possibly could. So what?

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.310
Thank you.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.109
Thank you.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.740
What did the doctor say?

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.510
What do we do now?

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.750
Do you remember talking about a clinical trial?

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.250
The best thing we can do right now...

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.560
is to join it once I've recovered a little.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.530
But since it's a clinical trial,

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.460
we don't know how effective the drug will be,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.570
And even if the drug turns out to be effective,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.470
by the time it's commercially available,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.340
there's no guarantee my body can hold out that long.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.110
Even if I die, I want to be here.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:24.850
With the people I love.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.850
No.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.420
You should go.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.960
You have to go.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.130
To be honest...

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.830
When I first heard about the trial at the flower shop...

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.900
Since I was unemployed...

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.300
I'm not going to lie, I did picture us leaving together.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.040
It'd be great at first, wouldn't it?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.810
Us, together in a strange country.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.980
But then, eventually...

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.420
We'd feel like we're sacrificing for each other.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720
Especially you.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.120
You'll think I'm sacrificing everything...

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.430
just to be by your side.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.960
We'd just end up...

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.900
wearing each other down.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.940
Je Yeon.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.440
Why are you thinking about all this?

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.280
Why did you think that far ahead?

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.150
I wanted to pretend it wasn't true,

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.380
but that's the reality of it.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.090
In your heart, you've already sent me there.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.790
What are we going to do now?

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560
For now...

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.530
How about we make a promise? Any promise.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.670
For something good.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.070
Stamp it.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.710
Copy it.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.429
- Hello. - You're here.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.900
Hey, Je Yeon. Where's Hae?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.840
He just fell asleep.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.410
Gosh, what terrible timing.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.750
Je Yeon, you should go get some rest. You'll collapse at this rate.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.010
I'll stay here with him.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.919
Hae gave me the key to the flower shop.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.490
Okay, give it to me. I can stop by when I get a chance.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.630
Can I take care of it?

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.049
(Mo Tae Rin)

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.489
Hey, can we watch the premiere of "Starving for Love" together?

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.190
We've always watched the premiere together.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.859
If you want a cosy night watching it alone with Bebop,

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.830
I won't stop you.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.830
Oh, please.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.970
Where did he go? Why are you alone?

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.010
I don't want to be without Hae.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.950
He wants to break up already?

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.420
Gosh, that guy. What should I do with him?

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.320
I was going easy on him because he's with my friend.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.760
I ought to just...

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.340
Hae...

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.440
He's sick.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.050
To get better, he has to go far away.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.520
But...

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.820
What if something goes wrong while he's there?

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.390
What if I never see him again?

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.140
No, even if I don't...

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.440
Even if I never see him again, it's okay.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.380
As long as he's alive.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.550
Even if I'm not with him,

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.560
as long as he's alive and well.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.030
How can this be happening?

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.200
I'm so scared, Tae Rin.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.850
What's going to happen to Hae?

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.130
He's going to be okay.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.770
Chan.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.150
Have you eaten?

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.520
Oh, hey, when did you get here?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.560
You should get something to eat.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.600
Let me just get changed, and I'll make you something.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.870
I was thrilled to get your call out of the blue.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.139
Thank you for the offer.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.610
I took too long to get back to you, didn't I?

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.680
Well, Je Yeon...

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.550
told me I could trust you with it.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.820
The rights to my original work...

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.320
I'm signing them all over to you.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.890
I promise I'll take good care of it.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.030
To be honest, from your reaction when we met,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.760
I didn't think you were going to sell.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.030
I need the money.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.770
I have to go away for a while, unexpectedly.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.339
So, how will we stay in touch?

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.870
Should we just use the phone or do video calls?

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.970
How long will you be gone?

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.280
A little over two years.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.710
But your forehead...

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.679
What happened?

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.780
Oh, this?

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.920
I got overexcited getting ready for a date and took a fall.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.320
Wow, you must have been really excited.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.729
Tae Rin will be here soon.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.290
If you have time, why don't you join us for dinner?

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.500
I'll have to take a rain check.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.970
It's cold out. Make sure you don't catch anything.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.200
Well, I should get going.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.130
Back when I went by Beat,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.300
a coworker I saw on set every day suddenly disappeared.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.200
His name was Bibap.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.710
One day we were hanging out, eating, fighting,

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.040
and I'd make him cry.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.910
So...

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.450
Did you use me as an excuse to cry again?

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.780
No.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.190
For some reason, I just don't think he would cry.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.060
So I figured I should try not to, either.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.490
Because he'd be strong about it.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.900
And I'm sure he still is.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.270
So I guess I should try to be too.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.300
It was good to see you.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.270
- Are you not seeing me anymore? - No.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.010
I'm going to keep seeing you.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.880
Well, I don't want to.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.149
So what?

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.649
Stop bothering Je Yeon.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.220
You worry about yourself.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.390
I'm always good to her.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.290
Gosh.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.640
I seriously can't stand you.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.720
I couldn't find the pen.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.120
But I got you this instead.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.289
Mine was too small. I didn't think your stuff would fit.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.259
Where did you get the money for this?

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.800
I worked part-time at Geon No's.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.870
I wanted to get it for you.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.040
Are you that moved?

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.700
No...

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.540
You...

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.110
Wait, you get an allowance from me, and from that guy too.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.950
So where did all that money go that you had to work part-time?

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.219
Does that big jerk make you work for him or something?

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.420
No!

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.390
I was buying something nice,

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.020
so I just chipped in a little. What's the big deal?

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.260
Stop being so frugal all the time.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.530
You need to let it show sometimes.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.670
How you're really feeling.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.070
Like if you're hurting or having a hard time.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.550
You know, when you were little, Nu Ri.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.990
I'd always have you check out library books,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.260
and it was only on payday...

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.590
that I'd buy you a new storybook. Remember?

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.730
But the first time I bought you a new book,

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.170
you said it had a funny smell.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:07.980
I shouldn't have skimped on that.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.050
I didn't read them anyway, so whatever.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.420
You were smart to save your money.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.260
Nu Ri.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.900
Hey, can you take a picture of me?

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.760
Why?

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.200
For what?

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.940
My new book is about to come out.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.280
I want to put my photo in it this time.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.380
Go change your clothes.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.490
Put on the nicest thing you own.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.610
Hey.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.040
Ready to go?

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:27.590
Go with your son.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.470
After you sent his mother away like that,

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.410
you were tormented with guilt your entire life.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.980
Looking back on it all now,

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.890
I realised we got off on the wrong foot.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.430
We fought with each other,

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.330
we shared our meals,

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.240
and we even raised a child together.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.410
I was always floundering in my own fantasies,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.880
but you always brought me back down to earth.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.720
But were you really okay living a life like that with me?

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.060
What could you have possibly wanted with a guy like me?

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:43.770
Love?

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.110
That's the one thing we did right, wasn't it?

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.210
And when you're back,

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.980
if what I want is to love you again...

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.790
What do you say we give it another shot?

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.220
Maybe for once,

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.290
we should try having a proper breakup.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.400
We've already been apart for over ten years.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.170
What's one more year?

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.840
Gosh, you're really something else.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.670
You lucked out, that's what.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.040
You know, a long time ago...

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.210
Do you remember when I came looking for you?

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.250
"Come with me."

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.190
I know I have no right to say this,

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.620
but I've never once thought of you as a burden.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.500
I'm the one who made it hard on you from the very beginning.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.800
I'm glad you realise that.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.470
Right?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.170
What a relief.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.640
Dad.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.580
Yes?

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.280
That old photo album of mine...

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.750
Why did you hold on to it all this time?

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.360
That old relic.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:51.090
A relic's only meaningful when it's discovered in the present.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.100
All those pictures...

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.570
Who do you think took them all?

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.510
Always trying to take the credit...

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.440
Bye.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.410
Hold on...

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:20.760
Extended Closure.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.429
It's not temporary. For lease.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.060
But it's not for lease.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.830
You're coming back to it.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.030
Oh, right.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.669
What should I put? I'm so bad at this kind of thing.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:34.740
I know.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.440
So what are you going to do there?

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.040
You won't just be at the hospital the whole time, right?

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.680
I need to think about you.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.009
Well, that's a given.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.580
Maybe I'll get the reissue ready.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.520
Good idea.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.790
Then while you're at it,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.460
you should write something new too.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.869
(You said you didn't like writers.)

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.670
Oh, come on...

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.410
You really hold a grudge.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.210
It just stuck with me.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.010
I noticed you've never written a love story.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.750
Why bother?

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.980
Are those really that interesting?

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.020
You don't think they are?

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.690
I'm speaking as a reader.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.230
Seriously, your writing is great.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.430
That's a bold claim.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.270
All of a sudden, I want to do everything I can for you.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.840
Do it.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.550
When you get back.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.550
Well, let's not get too dramatic.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.990
I'll just live like I always have.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.060
Miss you...

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.300
and just live my daily life.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.560
The life you'll return to.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.870
I'm worried about the time difference.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.440
I know I'll want to check on you every single day.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.210
To see if you're doing well, if you're okay.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.780
I'll have to try not to do that too much.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.620
Let's try our best to sync up.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.760
When our day and night meet.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.090
Okay?

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:37.730
Okay.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:43.470
What is it?

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.970
What is this? What is it?

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.680
You keep it.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.820
So you want me to manage it for free?

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.759
Correct answer from someone...

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.790
who studied business in Seoul National University.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.330
I knew you were smart.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.659
- When... - Yes?

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.860
When you get back,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.900
I'm going to collect all my back pay.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.170
Double.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.840
Go ahead.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.710
- Still don't know what to write? - If it's not a lease...

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.350
Yes, I'm looking at it now.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.150
I like the fourth mock-up.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.950
Okay, let's go with this one.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.760
About that...

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.160
I can keep in touch with the author through video calls,

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.660
so you don't have to worry.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.360
Tell her not to worry about the time difference.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.830
I'll work around her schedule.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.630
Okay. Yes, I'll call you then.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.340
Ta-da!

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.180
It's so strange seeing you work.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.780
Seeing you actually earning a living.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.680
Oh, the tea's gotten cold.

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:11.289
I guess I'll have to brew a new pot to about 65 degrees.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.860
Oh, right. I meant to ask.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.260
About the revised edition...

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:18.859
It should have something extra compared to the original, right?

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.430
Is there anything new we could add?

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.229
Like an interview with the author...

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.270
An interview?

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:25.470
With you?

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.800
What about an audiobook?

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.740
A new short story...

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.110
That might be too much?

00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:31.770
Even a really short one...

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.139
is still asking a lot, isn't it?

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.310
Actually, I was already thinking about writing something new.

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:37.150
Oh, that's great!

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.320
I'll do my best to help.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.149
Just stick to your poetry.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.890
You were scribbling something about "Instant Love" or whatever.

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:48.260
If there's even just one person who reads my poetry,

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:50.390
I write for that one person.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.230
- I write my poems... - I'm heading out.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.530
Yes, you should go.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.060
See you at the airport.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:40.210
(On vacation)

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:04.500
He must've used it roughly.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.100
All right. Time to start the day!

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.210
Okay.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.030
Hello, everyone.

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.660
Hello, hello.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.870
How is everyone?

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.370
Ah, thank you.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.670
Okay, got it!

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.940
Let's move to the other side, please!

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:18.870
Okay, moving out!

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.330
Hey.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.000
Pat, pat.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.260
Pat, pat!

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.970
How do I look? Perfect, right?

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.800
Perfect.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.740
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.170
How are you feeling?

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.070
Great.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.179
(Congratulations)

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.550
Congratulations on graduating, Nu Ri.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.179
Hae made this graduation bouquet for you.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.820
He said it won't ever wilt.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:04.550
What's this?

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.820
I can't believe he did this.

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:09.590
Hey, can you hold this for a sec?

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:16.570
Just a graduation... just a bouquet, just a congrats.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.070
- And it's from your brother. - Gosh.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.000
You really know how to hold a grudge.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:25.680
Nu Ri.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.210
Congrats on graduating.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.550
Congrats to you too.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.480
Oh, you're Seok Joo, right?

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.920
Hi, I'm Choi Sa Rang.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:36.950
Oh, right.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.690
I heard your boyfriend got into a school in Seoul?

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.920
But Nu Ri is moving into the dorms. What will you two do, so far apart?

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.130
If only I had studied a little harder...

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.000
I'm sorry, Sa Rang.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.600
No.

00:38:48.601 --> 00:38:51.429
Even if you had done much better, it would've turned out the same.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:52.440
It's okay.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.869
Are you done?

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.600
No, I'm not.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.040
I love you.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.480
Sa Rang!

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.710
What? You're here.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.519
What? What are you doing here?

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.520
You know my brother?

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.620
Of course!

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.320
Congrats on graduating and getting into college.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.490
- Where are Mom and Dad? - They went on a trip.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.789
Apparently, they mixed up the date.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.030
And they went anyway?

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:19.830
I barely made it here myself.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.270
I got my driver's license.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.700
Oh, me too.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.540
Nu Ri.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.170
Mom!

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.480
Congratulations on graduating.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.550
Your brother would be so proud.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.720
He probably would've just said, "Proud."

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:42.750
Hello there!

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.450
I'm the Choi Boy!

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.620
Is your friend's name "Choi Boy?"

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:50.860
I have no idea.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.430
I'm so embarrassed I could die.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.770
That's it.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:58.130
We should just break up.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:01.270
We're 20 now. Let's agree not to say rash things.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.540
I'm yours. Forever.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880
Okay.

00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:08.440
We'll be serving your meal now.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.150
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:19.320
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.489
Okay, so today's meal is completely within your diet plan.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.200
I just tried to make it as tasty as I could.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.499
Why do you keep going to all this trouble?

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.999
I enjoy doing it, so it's no trouble at all.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.030
That's not what I mean.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:34.799
All this grocery shopping, food prep,

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.940
and the time you take to plate it so nicely...

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:39.680
You could be practising your driving.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.509
I even had to park the car for you earlier.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.049
I was reviewing "Femicide for Love" yesterday...

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:47.319
and just made this while I was at it.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.320
Honestly.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.890
You always have an answer for everything.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.020
So?

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.420
What did you think?

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.460
I don't know good acting from bad,

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.729
but the pasta scene felt a little awkward.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.860
I don't know.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.970
It felt kind of unnatural.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.329
That can't be right.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.600
Really? What was awkward about it?

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.909
No, I mean, what was so awkward and unnatural about it?

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.940
I have to know what it was to fix it, right?

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:15.380
Go on, you can be honest.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.850
I said tell me. Hurry up.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:22.080
I'll play it for you right now. Tell me what you think to my face.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.390
Be honest.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.590
Hey, Gi Ppeum...

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.319
Go to the van and grab me anything.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.590
- Take your time but hurry up. - Okay.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:41.900
Gosh, I'm so tired.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:11.330
Gosh, this spot is so tight...

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.440
I wonder what your definition of "tight" is.

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.769
I told you. Turn the wheel fully and ease in slowly.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.069
Just get the back end in.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:20.140
Slowly straighten the wheel. Like so.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:22.580
Like this?

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.350
I thought you were a good student.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.990
How can you have no spatial awareness?

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.490
Oh, is it because, mathematically, this is just too simple for you?

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.030
Excuse me? What's with the informal tone?

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.160
- What was that? - You think I want to be polite?

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.900
At this rate, the museum will close before we park.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.970
Seriously. Don't take this the wrong way.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.270
Are you hungry, by any chance?

00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.980
No...

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.320
Where are you going?

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.720
Tae Rin, I'm sorry.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.050
Tae Rin.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.760
All right, keep it coming!

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.030
All right, keep it coming!

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.400
This is the last chance. Last chance. Come on, let's do this.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.770
Enjoy your meal.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.380
Welcome.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.320
No tables here either.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.090
We missed the exhibition because we were parking.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.360
And now I'm actually starving.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.960
Excuse me, when do you think a table will open up?

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:46.699
Is there a waiting list I can get on?

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.160
We don't have a list.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.230
Everyone just recently sat down, so I'm not sure when one will open.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:55.500
Oh, Ma'am.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.340
Gosh, it's you.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:58.670
Mom.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.640
Well, what are you...

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.280
What are you two doing here?

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.320
So you still come here.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.380
Yes.

00:44:08.381 --> 00:44:10.920
You're the one who taught me about all these great places.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.390
So, are you two a thing?

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.660
No.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.930
- We're not? - Of course not.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.700
You're just my tax accountant.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.400
"Just" your tax accountant?

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.370
I'm just going to use the restroom.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.010
And I'm not running away, ma'am.

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.330
Don't ask me why I'm alone.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:58.630
I just didn't want to go home.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240
What's going on?

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.410
No broken boiler at home these days?

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.420
Oh, actually, my water got shut off.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:17.820
Can I crash at your place tonight?

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.420
Sure.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.989
But is it just you chasing after her?

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:26.260
Gosh, Mom.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.760
- It's mutual. - Mutual, my foot.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:31.630
That's right. It's mutual.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.140
(On vacation)

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.950
Hey, guys.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.090
You're very thorough.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.430
And one face did come to mind.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.930
If you could see me now,

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:40.800
what would you say?

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.340
I'd say I miss you.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.380
I guess I said it out loud.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.500
What was that?

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.530
What are you... What are you doing here?

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.230
Want to go to the sea with me?

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.200
All of a sudden?

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.570
Have you been drinking?

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.840
Yes.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.310
I had a drink after work.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.280
And I was just writing my will.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:22.610
Excuse me?

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.110
Wait, why would you...

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.120
I update it every year.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.190
I looked at last year's version, and I found something.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.190
"When will I finally leave the shallows..."

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.700
"and swim out into the deep sea?"

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.270
And not just emotionally shallow.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.770
They meant the shallow end of a pool.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.840
I got that from the context.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.480
Oh, right. You said you were a good student.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.420
Are you a good swimmer too?

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.190
Well...

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.820
Guess not.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.590
I mean, I can swim a little.

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.060
But I'd be the one driving.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.260
And with my skills...

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.099
With your skills, even if we left right now,

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.240
we wouldn't get there until the day after tomorrow.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.910
So, for tonight, how about...

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:32.210
you come up to my place first?

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.760
I...

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.130
I don't go into just anyone's home.

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.960
So maybe you should make me...

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:46.330
your boyfriend.

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.510
I'll see how you behave.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.150
Oh, come on.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.910
Well, since I was invited,

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:07.580
I might as well go on up.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.620
Is it this way? Oh, or this way?

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.020
This way?

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:18.760
(World Made of Ash)

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.070
Your son's a great writer.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:25.530
He is, isn't he?

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.810
Where is he? Did you come back alone?

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.880
You're back sooner than we expected, aren't you?

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:42.480
I came to get ready for the book launch party.

Finally.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.980
I told you the title should've been, "A World Made of Gold Bars."

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.420
Here's your coffee.

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.620
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

I'll be following in your footsteps soon enough.

Into the world of film-making.

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.760
I heard you have the rest of Seonwoo Hae's novels.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.700
They'll be hard to adapt.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.600
What is it this time?

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.070
What's the "practical" reason you called me here?

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.340
You could have just sent it by mail.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:17.910
I just wanted an excuse to see you.

You're not making me read this, are you?

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.320
My throat's sore.

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:02.189
Then quit smoking.

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:03.729
Or pay me.

Nu Ri, are you asleep?

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.669
Why is it that Hae's books always put me to sleep?

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.930
You weren't even reading. I was reading it to you.

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:47.769
I guess my voice was too soothing?

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:49.100
Whatever.

When you watched "My Annoying Daughter..."

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.890
You felt it, didn't you? That she wrote it about you.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.090
Was it just me?

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.730

Tell her to get me out of her head.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.439
Do you think she's honeymooning with different partners?

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.150
Or has it been 60 years with the same person?

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.250
She keeps changing them.

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.150
Sounds tempting, doesn't it?

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.750
Think of it as Mo Tae Rin's personal harem.

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:43.390
A whole harem... I wonder if I can handle all that.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.830
You trust me, right?

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.160
You can. But...

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.770
you have to review the script first.

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.070
Should I give it a read, then?

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.110

No, no. It's just...

I'm feeling a little insecure.

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.860
I do like this kind of work, but...

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:22.700
I'm just not sure if a company like this...

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.039
Shouldn't I be spreading my wings in a bigger world?

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.040
Hey.

You two are friends.

Seok Joo is so formal with him.

You're right.

Seriously, what's gotten into you?

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:45.430
Should we meet up on this day every year?

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.400
What would the four of us even do? It sounds kind of pointless.

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:53.510
We all went to the same school. We can just call it a reunion.

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.139
Not that I've ever actually been to one.

00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.779
Make a time capsule and open it ten years from now?

00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:59.880
You want to make a cheesy promise like that?

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.080
So should we bury the time capsule somewhere on the outskirts?

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:04.689
Seoul is too crowded.

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:06.749
And you're sure that spot won't get redeveloped?

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.760
That it'll even still be there?

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:11.089
If we bury it, would that be real estate speculation?

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:12.759
No, that's bad for the environment.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.830
Then let's put it in a bottle and toss it in the sea.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.430
That's bad for the environment too. No.

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:20.669
How about suggesting an idea instead of just shooting everything down?

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:21.670
All right, fine.

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:24.240
Anyone want more coffee? I'm getting another cup.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:26.610
I'll have one! And let's get dessert too.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:28.310
- Sounds good. - Me too.

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:30.850
Hey, get me one too!

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:32.810
But you didn't finish your coffee.

00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:38.590
Back during your shoot,

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.860
you wrote those letters, right?

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.290
- Yes. - What did you write?

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:45.860
You're really not going to tell me?

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:46.960
Nope.

00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.200
So you'll have to wonder forever.

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.370
Gosh, seriously...

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.680
Is this...

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.050
a dream?

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.410
Please tell me it's not.

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:42.650
Can't I just stay asleep?

00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:47.990
I want to keep looking at you.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:54.600
Can't I?

00:59:58.030 --> 00:59:59.130
Excuse me.

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.470
I'm looking for someone named "Start of Spring."

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:05.440
Oh, yes.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.310
(To "Start of Spring")

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.880
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.620
(To "Start of Spring")

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:46.980
The first season I ever experienced.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.150
That year.

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:54.060
I wonder if anyone else remembers that first snow.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.520
The me in the photograph, frozen in a moment,

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.620
sometimes looks like a stranger.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.560
More and more, as time goes on.

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:33.230
I was so innocent.

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:35.900
I had dreams.

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:38.230
I loved.

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.470
So endearingly clumsy.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.880
So bright it hurt my eyes.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.950
That's how dazzling it was.

01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:57.890
Some moments still remain.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:00.620
Perhaps forever.

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.890
As if they are the present.

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:10.470
I'd only forgotten for a little while.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.470
I was so happy to greet...

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.000
all the things that never really disappeared.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.730
Wait, how is this...

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.680
Hi.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.250
What?

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.950
Our vacation was until next month.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:41.390
Let's go see the flowers.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.060
They're blooming.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.539
Is it really you?

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.240
Wait, am I dreaming again?

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.120
Look.

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:12.290
I have a reflection in the mirror.

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:19.090
And I have a shadow.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.840
Can I take a picture of you too?

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:41.180
So, are you going to say hi back or what?

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.380
You're really here.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.190
You're warm.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.260
Hi?

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:32.130
Hi.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.510
Hoping that somewhere, we'll meet again...

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:44.980
with a happy hello, again and again.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.620
From Sunwoo Hae.

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:54.560
(Thanks to the viewers who shared every moment with us.)

01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:29.260
(On vacation)

01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:42.170
