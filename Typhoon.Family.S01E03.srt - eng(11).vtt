TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.386
Hey! Move aside!

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.637
We cannot

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.057
deliver those to Daebang Textile!

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.002
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.090
Things will get busy later,
so why don't you stamp here first?

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:32.050
Sorry.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.968
Can I use the restroom?

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:37.430
Oh, it's out the door to your right.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:40.642
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

00:01:59.077 --> 00:01:59.994
Let's move!

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.287
Let's go!

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:05.291
-Come on!
-Let's go, everyone!

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.544
Let's defend our workplace!

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.008
-Pay our wages!
-Pay our wages!

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.802
-This way!
-Protect our workplace!

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.512
Protect our workplace!

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.894
-Pay our wages!
-Pay our wages!

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.105
Come this way!

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.234
DON'T SHUT DOWN THE COMPANY
PAY OUR WAGES

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:34.320
FACTORY SHUTS DOWN

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.907
LETTER OF APPEAL

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.306
I'm not scared.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.726
I'm not scared at all.

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.495
Wait!

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:28.917
Tae-poong!

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:32.462
Wait!

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.714
Hold on, Mr. Kang!

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:37.050
Just wait a minute!

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.429
Why are you lying down?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.514
Did you

00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:44.933
send the fax?

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.518
No, I didn't. Look at this.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:55.985
My gosh.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:58.613
Get up.

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:01.282
-Don't just lie there.
-Okay.

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:19.509
That darn boss tried to run off
with the goods without paying.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.426
What now?

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.596
You should go back.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.851
-You must all be exhausted.
-We're just doing our job, aren't we?

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:33.564
-Do you have a place to store these?
-Come on, this isn't our first rodeo.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.819
We'll get a warehouse ready
and cover your travel expenses.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.696
You should go before it's too late.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.074
-Grab the cancellation documents.
-Okay.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.827
You should go back with him, Tae-poong.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.330
I'll call the office
and ask them to look for a warehouse.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.540
-All right.
-Good.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.750
Start your engines, guys.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.461
-We've got a long way to go.
-Take care.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:02.844
Tae-poong.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:07.598
-Yes?
-Those guys, especially Mr. Baekâ€¦

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.185
-They're veterans in this field.
-Veterans?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.771
Nothing gets past them.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:15.398
I see.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.817
I'll figure out the warehouse somehow.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.404
When you get to Incheon,
be sure to buy us some time.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.322
Got it.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:35.668
Get some sleep.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:40.089
-It's okay. I'm not sleepy.
-I doubt that.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.926
Riding in a huge truck
makes everyone sleepy.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.428
We're just used to it.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.141
Take this.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.731
What's your name?

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.858
I'm Kang Tae-poong.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.028
-"Tae-poong"?
-Yes.

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:05.948
-Who names their kid that?
-My dad.

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.620
It's a nice name.
It leaves a strong impression.

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.164
Weren't you scared earlier?

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:17.835
I was.

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.505
But why did you do that?

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:24.092
If this goes wrong,
I heard our company could go under.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:27.261
Is your company
more important than your life?

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.478
It's worth 26 years of my dad's life.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.575
I gave it to you for a reason.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.911
-You can have it.
-Thank you.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:04.590
TYPHOON TRADING

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.175
Yes, two warehouses.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:10.012
-We know, but this was sudden for us too.
-Do you have a spare warehouse?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.641
-The goods are on their way.
-We need those warehouses, sir.

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:15.893
I'm Thong-jung from French Literature.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.228
Do you remember me?

00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:20.565
I was wondering
if I could ask you for a favor.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.817
Who rents out a warehouse on credit?

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.653
You need to pay upfront.
Your company should know better.

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:27.238
I'm disappointed, sir.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.783
You're acting different just
because Mr. Kang isn't here.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.454
We've got three containers
of fabric on the way.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.789
I can't find a warehouse
in the middle of the night.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.542
Companies are going bankrupt
left and right these days.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.127
Can you please help just this once?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.423
-Did it work, Mr. Koo?
-I've asked banks and loan companies.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.800
No one will give us any money.

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:52.305
I'm well aware
that everyone is struggling right now.

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:54.891
Couldn't you find a way somehow?

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:57.852
Open up!

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:01.814
They know the boss is back at the company.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.358
-Show responsibility!
-Show responsibility!

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:07.945
CONTRACT TERMINATION AGREEMENT

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.823
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.410
-I'm sorry.
-We're the ones who are sorry.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.370
More importantly,
how will you get out of here?

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:19.540
Let's go!

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.173
PROTECT OUR FACTORY

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.966
-Let's go!
-Come on!

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.135
After them!

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.349
Unload the goods.

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:38.684
-Hurry up!
-Please, wait.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:39.977
Please listen to me.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.104
-Come on!
-Can you please stop and listen?

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.273
-Step aside.
-Sir! Please, wait.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:47.401
We're looking into it.
Please give me more time.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:48.319
Forget it.

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:53.282
-Stop fooling around.
-You can't just unload it like this.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.450
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:57.411
What are you going to do with it?

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.289
-Hold on for a bit.
-Why should we?

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.709
He's been wasting our time
for an hour now.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.713
-You said you'll get a warehouse.
-Kang Tae-poong.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.758
-Have they called you?
-Wait a minute.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.095
Can you please keep this
in your truck for a few days?

00:09:14.178 --> 00:09:17.306
-Please? At least until tomorrow.
-What kind of nonsense is that?

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:21.561
Give us our return fee right now.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.271
I will.

00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:27.024
I promise I will. Don't throw them!

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:31.445
Do you know
how expensive these are? Stop it!

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.714
-Are you okay?
-Are you nuts?

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.925
Why did you jump on the road?
Are you crazy?

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.053
We're sorry, okay? Just go.

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:03.102
Here's the deal, Kang Tae-poong.

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:07.857
Let's settle today's travel expenses
at a later time.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.151
But we'll need to unload the goods.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.945
I get that your situation is tough,

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:16.365
but those people
are barely getting by day-to-day too.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.909
Got it? Now, get up.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.622
-Thank you.
-Everyone's out of work these days.

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:26.917
-People are really struggling.
-You're right.

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:30.463
It must be hard for you.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.507
You see that parking lot over there?

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:37.178
Those parking lots

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:41.307
used to be packed with trucks like ours.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.518
Now they're completely empty.

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:47.021
Is the parking fee expensive?

00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:49.315
What parking fee?

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:52.068
I told you, there's no work.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.331
Hey, Kang Tae-poong.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:35.027
EPISODE 3
MOONLIGHT IN SEOUL

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:41.659
NEW STAR MUSIC COMPETITION

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:52.795
-Number 32, Mr. Wang Nam-mo.
-I'm Wang Nam-mo, Number 32.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:53.921
Right now?

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:58.384
THE 9TH NEW STAR MUSIC COMPETITION

00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:01.804
I'm sorry, my hand slipped.

00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:07.393
-Sorry, I'm really nervous.
-It's okay. I was like you once.

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:11.188
Take a deep breath
and begin when you're ready.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.065
Okay. Thank you.

00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:26.871
I miss you at times like these

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.250
Moments when I'm all alone

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:35.421
Even though I know you're gone

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:41.051
I keep thinking of you

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.639
Why did you leave me back then?

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:51.270
You said you were tired of it all

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:55.483
I guess that could be the reason

00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:00.279
But I just don't understand

00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:03.699
Lonely night, lonely night

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:09.205
I keep remembering how you left me

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:14.919
Lonely night, so lonely night

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:27.389
The way I want to remember you

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:37.316
Thank you. I'm Number 32, Wang Nam-mo.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:58.003
Back up!

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:03.884
-Keep going.
-This is so heavy.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:08.430
-This is some hard labor we're doing.
-Okay, let's stop.

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:09.348
Pick it up.

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:13.143
Move it to the left.

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:15.145
How can you still get this wrong?
To the left.

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.689
Hurry up.

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:19.817
Hurry up, Man No. 2. This one's next.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.195
-One, two, three.
-This is the last one, right, Man No. 3?

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.363
Jeez.

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:29.577
Those birds are pissing me off!

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.620
Stop yelling.

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.248
-Save your strength.
-Stop paging me.

00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:36.834
You think this is it?

00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:39.336
-There's more.
-Gosh.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.796
Come on.

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:46.552
Don't let it go over the line.
It'll cost more if it does.

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:48.387
You can always pay for more.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.180
-I don't have money.
-Really?

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.891
-Okay, then--
-Wait!

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:53.392
-Grab it!
-It's falling!

00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:55.352
Crap.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:57.897
Did it go over?

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.609
This side is okay. I'm falling.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.281
Come on.

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:12.411
-Grab it.
-Oh, my gosh.

00:15:12.494 --> 00:15:15.623
-Don't step on it!
-I didn't mean to.

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:16.790
Why'd you step on it?

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:20.336
I can't believe you're making
me work my butt off.

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:22.254
Come on.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:25.674
Hurry up.

00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:29.887
One, two, three.

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:34.308
All right. Keep an eye on it. Okay.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.520
-What did Tae-poong say?
-He said he put them someplace safe.

00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:42.775
Shouldn't we go check on it?

00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:45.903
He said he'll take care of it,
so let's look for warehouses.

00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:47.112
So, where is that?

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:49.531
What?

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.742
You didn't ask.

00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:53.744
You didn't ask where he placed them.

00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:56.580
-I didn'tâ€¦
-What?

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.374
I didn't ask him.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.603
I won't let anyone take these.

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:56.765
What's that?

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.737
Kang Tae-poong!

00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:12.281
Tae-poong!

00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:16.702
Gosh, Tae-poongâ€¦

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:19.663
Are you okay?

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.498
My goodness.

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:25.294
From far away, it looked like
a scene from that movieâ€¦

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.546
The Gingko Bed.

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:29.173
Was it General Eun?

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.134
It's Hwang.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.347
-Yes, General Hwang.
-Gosh.

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:40.184
Just look at him.

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:45.481
Compared to the freezing cold
we're used to, this place is the equator.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.524
I'm actually hot here.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.195
You served in the military, right?

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.032
Where were you stationed?

00:17:56.658 --> 00:18:01.580
-Changwonâ€¦
-By the way, we found a place.

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:03.957
They lent us money on credit.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:11.924
You may have heard,
but I was in the Marines.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.968
Batch 498.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.013
I was seriouslyâ€¦

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.351
Don't even get me started.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.395
Back then, at the seaâ€¦

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:29.191
You know what, forget it.
I'll just keep it to myself.

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:30.692
I guess you don't want any.

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:33.612
Let's get a move on, guys.

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:37.199
We have stuff to do back there.
Let's go and see.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:40.119
Help him up.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:45.415
-You're quite a handful.
-One, two, three.

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:48.252
My legs are asleep.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:53.257
How will you get any work done like that?

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.677
-Just put the bag down.
-My legs are numb.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.095
Are you ready?

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:05.018
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:13.944
You should've told me sooner
that this happened.

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:18.991
Your father and I were not strangers.

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:27.875
-Work hasn't been easy, has it?
-I still have no idea what I'm doing.

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.294
Work is kind of like learning to walk.

00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.214
It feels shaky and uncertain at first.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.009
Everyone else seems to be doing fine

00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:41.221
while you're struggling not to fall
just after a few steps.

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:42.431
But here's the thing.

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.643
You can't learn unless you fall.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.187
That's just how it goes.

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:53.609
Hello?

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:55.694
Is it ready?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.196
All right.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.825
It's ready, so go check it out.

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:07.039
-Gosh, thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:09.041
We should help each other out.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:10.709
Thank you.

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.630
This should be enough.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:25.682
-Did you take a look?
-Yes, I took a good, close look.

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:30.312
The contract is very detailed.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.523
-Excuse me.
-My gosh!

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:37.402
I suppose you don't use this often?

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:38.487
It's rather run-down.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.740
We've done some repairs.
What do you mean it's run-down?

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:45.535
No, I mean,
the cracks in the floor are fine,

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:51.291
but if you look here,
not only are there cracks here,

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:54.628
but the ceiling
has holes everywhere, doesn't it?

00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:56.129
Is that for ventilation?

00:20:56.713 --> 00:21:00.842
If you look here,
even the rebar is rusted.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.803
It looks like it could collapse.

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:05.889
And over there, the cracks are stacked
like Tetris blocks.

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:08.308
There are holes over there too.

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:10.352
And the window over hereâ€¦

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.481
Oh, Mr. Koo!

00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:17.234
Why are you doing that at your age?

00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:19.611
-Why are you trying so hard?
-I'm fine.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:24.366
You guys sure have a lot of complaints.
I guess you don't want the contract.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.785
I was trying to help you people, but fine.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:29.705
-Okay, I'm leaving.
-Wait, it's not like that.

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:30.998
Come on, Manager.

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:36.586
We're just really grateful,
so we wanted to use the space carefully.

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:38.046
Butâ€¦

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.133
That's why we're checking everything.
Let's wrap this up.

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:43.719
-Still, this is a bit--
-Thank you.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:44.970
CONTRACTOR: TYPHOON TRADING

00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:46.179
There we go.

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:52.019
-Don't make a mess.
-Thank you.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.521
Take care.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:58.191
Try to read the room, you guys!

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:01.570
Who else is willing to lend
on credit alone these days?

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:04.323
-Yeah, but still--
-Then what do you want us to do?

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:05.907
Should we take all the goods back?

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:09.411
Just keep the key safe, okay?

00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:16.209
Never mind, I don't trust you.
Give it back.

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:18.211
Give it here.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.841
My back hurts.

00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:27.137
Good thing we found out
Daebang went bankrupt before the delivery.

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:31.391
Let's try to sell at least a roll
and have ox bone stew for lunch tomorrow.

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.727
How are we supposed to sell all that?

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.563
I heard ox bone stew
helping bones heal is just a myth.

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:41.318
But you know,
we almost got screwed over, didn't we?

00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:43.111
Screws are used to secure things.

00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:47.240
Do you have trouble speaking Korean?

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:51.453
Actually, I had a bad feeling about it.

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:53.622
You all know about my intuition.

00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:55.082
A CRAPPY INTUITION

00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:57.626
What intuition? You're way too slow.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.212
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:04.549
-What are you looking so closely at?
-I just wanted to check it one more time.

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.426
Every little bit adds up.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.553
Bit by bit, it adds up.

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:12.015
What does that even mean?

00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:15.894
What are you guys looking at so intently?

00:23:15.977 --> 00:23:17.270
What is it? Let me see.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.815
LIST OF FOOD PRODUCTS

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:22.400
Why are you looking at food products?

00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:26.279
Are you planning to wrap
gochujang and doenjang in the fabric?

00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:30.408
I don't know which company you'll end up,
but they'll be tortured.

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:31.993
You're in for a tough time.

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:33.662
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:37.082
-Could you get us all a cup of coffee?
-Sure.

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:39.751
-Thanks.
-Ms. Oh. I'll have a two-two-three combo.

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:41.795
-I'll have my regular.
-Okay.

00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:43.672
-What about you, Ms. Cha?
-None for me.

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:46.091
Stop making her get coffee.

00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:47.968
-Would you like some?
-No, thanks.

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:57.769
One, three, one, four.

00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:01.231
Eight, seven, zero, five.

00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:14.786
-You scared me.
-It's 11:00 p.m.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.663
I've never worked until this late.

00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:21.668
Isn't that amazing?

00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:24.754
I really can achieve anything.

00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:27.757
What's wrong?

00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:29.551
The last train.

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.428
-The last train!
-You scared me.

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.598
-Grab your bag.
-Yes, we should go.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:41.897
Why do you insist on walking me home
when I can go by myself?

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.106
It's not that far.

00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:46.401
And it's not safe these days.

00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:50.030
It's late. You should go home.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.990
I can keep going.

00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:54.576
Lookâ€¦

00:24:59.414 --> 00:25:00.373
Thank you.

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:03.793
That day at the funeral.

00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.088
What you said about sadness.

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.141
I was talking to myself too.

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:24.731
I mean, I was sad
that Mr. Kang passed away,

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:26.399
but I had

00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:29.361
given up on my dream.

00:25:30.153 --> 00:25:31.321
It felt like a luxury.

00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:33.657
What's your dream?

00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:38.578
-You don't have to--
-To be an office worker.

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:42.249
Someone with duties of my own,
instead of being an assistant.

00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:44.209
Like a trader.

00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:48.630
-That's nice.
-Yes, it is.

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:56.972
-I should go. See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:59.307
-Take care.
-Get home safe.

00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:17.993
There's a saying among trading companies,

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.536
"From missiles to ramyeon."

00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:25.125
It means it's the job of a salesperson
to find good products and good clients.

00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:26.501
FROM MISSILES TO RAMYEON

00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:32.465
TRADER

00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:34.050
That's the skill of a trader.

00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:37.679
-Have you heard of the UAE?
-Arabâ€¦

00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:39.222
The desert.

00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:42.309
They're super rich because they have oil.

00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:46.563
But due to religious customs,
both men and women wear long clothing.

00:26:46.646 --> 00:26:48.606
That's where traders created a plan.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.025
Who has the best fabric?

00:26:51.318 --> 00:26:53.778
Italy. Who has
the best processing technology?

00:26:55.822 --> 00:26:56.656
South Korea.

00:26:57.741 --> 00:27:01.911
When our company imports fabric from Italy
and sells it to Daebang Textile,

00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:05.040
they reprocess it
and export it to the UAE.

00:27:05.915 --> 00:27:08.209
How do you know all this?

00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:12.922
I admire them.

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:17.177
I think traders are cool.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.974
TRADER

00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:25.602
A trader.

00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:47.499
-It's cold.
-You're dripping wet.

00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:49.626
You must be cold.

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:55.548
-You're all wet.
-Mi-seon, try this.

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:58.134
It's a really expensive cream.
My coworker gave it to me.

00:27:58.218 --> 00:27:59.636
No, thanks. You use it.

00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:02.597
-Stop it!
-Your face is a mess right now.

00:28:03.139 --> 00:28:04.474
Fine.

00:28:04.557 --> 00:28:06.518
-Put some on Beom.
-Good idea.

00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:08.812
-Which one do you want, Beom?
-Put it on.

00:28:08.895 --> 00:28:10.146
You must be freezing.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.940
You need to change your pants.
They're wet.

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:14.651
Here, it's warm. I warmed it up for you.

00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:16.820
-It's warm.
-Right?

00:28:16.903 --> 00:28:18.655
Let's dry your hair first.

00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:22.117
-How's your job at the department store?
-My job?

00:28:22.742 --> 00:28:24.828
-It's not bad.
-That's good to hear.

00:28:25.412 --> 00:28:26.704
BELLUA DEPARTMENT STORE

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:28.123
Let's begin the greeting.

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:32.293
A bright day starts with your smile.

00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:36.047
Good morning.

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:38.758
Welcome.

00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.760
OH MI-HO

00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:43.722
You there, your name tag is crooked.

00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:47.142
Is your attitude crooked too?
What's going on?

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.772
-Where's your name tag?
-My apologies.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:54.607
Good grief.

00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:57.277
All right, keep those smiles up.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.362
Let's start the greeting again.

00:28:59.446 --> 00:29:03.867
A bright day starts with your smile.

00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:07.162
-I can't believe this.
-How could this happen so suddenly?

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:08.413
HANJIN BANK
ULCHI BRANCH 2

00:29:08.496 --> 00:29:10.707
This is just too cruel.

00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:14.419
After all we've enduredâ€¦

00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:22.218
This is just unfair!

00:29:22.969 --> 00:29:28.475
All we did was work hard.
Why are we the ones losing our jobs?

00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:29.392
Mom!

00:29:32.061 --> 00:29:33.396
I told you not to come.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:35.648
You've worked so hard.

00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:39.152
You're finally free after 32 years.

00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:44.491
Thirty-two years?

00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:53.082
Only three more years, and Iâ€¦

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:57.337
would've gotten
the long-term service award.

00:30:16.689 --> 00:30:18.024
I knew this would happen.

00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:22.987
Goshâ€¦

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.491
It's not your fault, Mom.

00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:28.076
It's okay.

00:30:29.035 --> 00:30:30.119
Cry all you want.

00:30:33.373 --> 00:30:36.084
My husband died when I was 30 years oldâ€¦

00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:39.128
I know.

00:30:41.714 --> 00:30:42.966
Nam-moâ€¦

00:30:45.468 --> 00:30:48.847
KIM EUL-NYEO
ASSISTANT BRANCH MANAGER

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.391
I'm not crying.

00:30:56.271 --> 00:30:58.731
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:00.233
Yes.

00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:04.237
We've imported some stunning,
multicolored fabric from Italy,

00:31:05.405 --> 00:31:06.614
and right now, it'sâ€¦

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.868
You don't want it? Got it.

00:31:11.661 --> 00:31:13.162
-They don't want it.
-At all?

00:31:13.246 --> 00:31:16.541
Ms. Cha, have you reached out
to Fiori Textiles in Daegu?

00:31:16.624 --> 00:31:18.418
I contacted them ages ago.

00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:21.671
JUNG CHA-RAN

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:25.466
FX servicesâ€¦

00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:27.218
-Tae-poong?
-Yes?

00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:29.762
-Have you called Pusan?
-I'm doing it now.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.184
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:36.436
Hello, Typhoon Trading.

00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:40.899
-We've imported some fabric.
-Fabric? I don't work with those anymore.

00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:44.736
I see. Then could you
recommend us someplace else?

00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:48.656
I heard that a lot of factories
in Daegu are going under.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.868
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

00:31:51.951 --> 00:31:54.495
Thank you for picking up our call.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:58.791
I heard about Mr. Kang.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:02.879
Please reach out to me if you visit Pusan.
I really mean it.

00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:03.796
To Pusan?

00:32:04.464 --> 00:32:06.466
I will. Thank you.

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:14.265
The floor needs to be mopped, Ms. Oh.

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:16.059
Right away.

00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:21.105
So, did anyone want it?

00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:22.607
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:23.858
I wish.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.945
Who would start a new business
at a time like this?

00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:28.947
It's not like we only have a few.

00:32:29.906 --> 00:32:31.491
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

00:32:31.574 --> 00:32:34.369
-Get me a cup of coffee after that.
-Yes, sir.

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:35.578
Take your time.

00:32:37.413 --> 00:32:39.457
-Are you okay?
-What are we going to do?

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.918
None of our clients want it.

00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:44.879
We might actually end up losing our jobs.

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.881
At least your husband works.

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:51.344
I'm about to ask my old man
to pay for the baby's diapers.

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:54.555
Ms. Oh, are you still working on that?

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:56.182
Let's hurry it up.

00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:59.560
Why does he keep asking for coffee?

00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:04.732
Excuse me.

00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:08.987
Why don't we return them?

00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:22.333
I checked the contract,
and there's a clause.

00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.586
But it only applies
in the case of natural disasters.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.422
Isn't the IMF issue a natural disaster?

00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:31.134
You can't say that.
That's a man-made disaster.

00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:33.720
There are victims,
but no clear perpetrator.

00:33:33.803 --> 00:33:38.349
"Come" for complete, "plea" for begging,
a "call" for help, and "lapse" for breaks.

00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:40.560
It's a complete collapse.

00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:43.730
We're completely ruined.

00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:47.942
But I think this might still be possible.

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.319
The conditions are pretty strict, though.

00:33:50.403 --> 00:33:55.033
If quantity and quality remain unchanged,
the return fee is 15%.

00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:56.451
Honestly, 15% is a lot.

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:59.454
The fee's not the issue.
It's whether they'll accept it.

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.663
They probably won't.

00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:02.498
I thinkâ€¦

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.627
Let's double the amount to 30%.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.671
Then they'll accept them.

00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:11.215
Why don't you just hand everything over?

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:13.760
It says here
that the exchange rate went up.

00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:14.719
SURGE OF EXCHANGE RATES

00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:16.637
It's not a bad idea.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:21.893
The contract exchange rate was 907.5 won,
and today it's 1,823 won.

00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.728
If it keeps dropping like thatâ€¦

00:34:26.189 --> 00:34:27.190
She memorized all that?

00:34:27.273 --> 00:34:29.692
You memorized it? You're so weird, Ms. Oh.

00:34:34.363 --> 00:34:36.282
Wait, let me calculate this.

00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:38.618
It should beâ€¦

00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:41.204
That's going to take forever. Here.

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:46.042
The exchange rate jumps 200 won one day
and drops 100 won the next.

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:48.086
So, let's average it out at 1,600 won.

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:02.225
Even after 30% fees,
we still end up with a profit.

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:06.604
And if they refuse the return,
we'll tell them

00:35:06.687 --> 00:35:09.482
that we'll dump the fabric
on the market at half price.

00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:13.569
We may face some losses,
but we need to sell the goods first.

00:35:13.653 --> 00:35:14.487
Right.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:18.908
But the value of that fabric will plummet,
and it won't rise back up.

00:35:19.575 --> 00:35:21.035
Just like the Dutch tulips.

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:24.330
No one will pay 10,000 won
for something that dropped to 3,000.

00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:26.165
It's no longer a premium item.

00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:27.291
Don't you think so?

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.544
You think they'll risk that?

00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:33.756
-No, they'll accept the return.
-He's quite ruthless.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.466
I better stay on his good side.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.717
He's a thug.

00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:41.639
But it'll be Christmas soon.

00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:44.392
What? Do you go to church?

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:46.227
You don't look very religious.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.063
Europeans go on vacation during Christmas.

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:51.858
No one will be there to receive our fax.

00:35:54.193 --> 00:35:56.070
You're very smart, Mr. Bae.

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.282
-You're a genius.
-Episode 6 of Global Neighbors.

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:01.742
The one about Italy.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.414
Yes, they don't work very hard.

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.916
And yet, they haven't been hit
with the IMF.

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.836
We should still keep sending faxes though.

00:36:13.212 --> 00:36:14.422
Are we working overtime?

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:37.153
Is it working?

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:39.739
Is it?

00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:43.367
-Did you do it right?
-Yes.

00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.496
Did they send it?

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.956
-No.
-That's not it.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.166
We sent it.

00:36:50.249 --> 00:36:52.460
-He's never done this.
-Just wait.

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:10.811
-We got a call.
-It's here.

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:14.649
Hello?

00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:18.236
Hello?

00:37:18.861 --> 00:37:20.613
Don't pick up when there's a fax!

00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:22.865
It was ringing.

00:37:46.722 --> 00:37:48.766
TYPING PRACTICE

00:37:56.732 --> 00:37:57.733
BAD-MOUTH

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.411
GAME OVER

00:38:18.337 --> 00:38:19.964
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

00:38:22.049 --> 00:38:24.093
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

00:38:24.176 --> 00:38:26.429
Yes! I win!

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.479
There we go!

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.081
"We may not be mortal enemies."

00:38:56.917 --> 00:39:02.798
"But I will avenge my master's death
and captureâ€¦"

00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:04.967
What kind of story is this?

00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.012
It's quite old-fashioned.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.141
Are you keeping an eye on the fax?

00:39:12.224 --> 00:39:16.145
You're always reading that.
That's why you're always sleepy.

00:39:16.228 --> 00:39:20.524
Don't take your eyes off the fax machine.

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:21.942
You're closer to it.

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.862
"I'm not falling
for your nonsense anymore."

00:39:24.945 --> 00:39:26.447
Your attitude is horrible.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.365
"You fool."

00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:29.992
"I'll teach you a lesson."

00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:32.745
Let me see.

00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:34.789
This character's surprising.

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.040
-Look.
-Right.

00:39:36.123 --> 00:39:37.291
I'm reading it.

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.877
I almost got the wrong idea.

00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:44.715
Anyway, don't doze off.
Keep an eye on the fax.

00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:50.262
Let's go home, everyone.

00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:51.514
He's so dramatic.

00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:54.392
-Is he still breathing?
-Yes, he is.

00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:58.354
Let him sleep.
He's always pulling all-nighters.

00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:07.863
Why did you turn the lights off?
Ms. Oh's still here.

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:16.497
-Good night, Ms. Oh.
-Take care.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.581
Tae-poong?

00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:22.229
We got a fax.

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:23.147
-What?
-Get up.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.273
-We got a fax?
-Yes.

00:41:39.538 --> 00:41:42.374
"We've carefully reviewed your proposal."

00:41:49.715 --> 00:41:52.510
"We're well-aware
of the IMF issue in Korea."

00:41:56.889 --> 00:41:58.057
I can't read it.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.893
What's wrong? Is your stomach hurting?

00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:03.854
"This appears
to be beyond anyone's control."

00:42:04.438 --> 00:42:09.068
"Therefore, we are willing to make
an exception and accept your proposal."

00:42:10.152 --> 00:42:12.071
So, they'll accept the return?

00:42:14.281 --> 00:42:18.160
Only if there is no change
in quantity and quality.

00:42:21.163 --> 00:42:22.748
Hurray!

00:42:22.831 --> 00:42:25.376
-We did it!
-Finally!

00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:29.129
Yes! I was so worried
about what we were going to do.

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:32.132
We just need two more weeks.
It'll all work out.

00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:35.970
I'm so glad!

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:37.972
Send it to them now!

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.641
-Yes, send it now.
-What a joyous day. This is great.

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:42.851
We should get banquet noodles
on a day like this.

00:42:42.935 --> 00:42:44.853
-I agree.
-Sounds great!

00:42:44.937 --> 00:42:46.438
That sounds wonderful.

00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:48.274
Let's go!

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.864
Here you go.

00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:59.827
SILVER, GOLD

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.121
CERTIFICATE OF COLLATERAL

00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:03.497
Excuse meâ€¦

00:43:05.624 --> 00:43:07.751
This is less than I expected.

00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:12.131
We get around 30 to 40 bags
like this one each day.

00:43:12.214 --> 00:43:14.717
It's not like the Gangnam area
can avoid the IMF.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.552
I've only used it three times.

00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:21.181
Then why don't you trade your gold?
It's worth more.

00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:24.768
-What gold?
-The gold ring you're wearing.

00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:26.687
No! This is my wedding ring.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.816
Everyone's trading in their wedding rings
and other gold rings too.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:32.526
I don't want to.

00:43:33.193 --> 00:43:34.111
All right.

00:43:34.194 --> 00:43:35.863
That's too high! Lower it.

00:43:37.239 --> 00:43:41.201
I think it's about to rain.
Let's get a move on!

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:42.202
MOMO'S PUB

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:45.372
Hey, Mom.
Take it easy and try some chicken.

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:47.166
I'm such a perfect guy.

00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:49.752
I'm even good at frying chicken.

00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:51.962
It's a bit salty. Try it.

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:52.963
-Salty?
-Yes.

00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:55.007
It's salty.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:58.510
Make more of these
and give some to the workers.

00:43:58.594 --> 00:43:59.553
-Got it?
-Okay.

00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:01.096
Hello, sir.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.098
-Hello.
-How have you been?

00:44:03.182 --> 00:44:05.893
-You have a sign now.
-I'm starting a pub.

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.728
-I'll visit next time.
-Please do.

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.104
-Please stop by for dinner.
-Okay.

00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:11.649
Thank you. Have a nice day.

00:44:13.233 --> 00:44:17.905
Hey, mister!
Please lower the left side just a bit.

00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:48.644
Oh, man.

00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:51.522
It's pouring out there.

00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:56.610
-I'm going out, Mom.
-Where are you going at this hour?

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:59.113
It's raining. Take an umbrella, Tae-poong!

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:13.335
NOTICE OF FORCED EXECUTION

00:45:19.258 --> 00:45:21.635
Mister, it's me, Mi-seon!

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:24.388
Please open the door, mister!

00:45:25.013 --> 00:45:26.390
Mister!

00:45:28.308 --> 00:45:32.020
-What are you doing here?
-It's an emergency. Please help me!

00:45:32.104 --> 00:45:35.482
-It's raining too much. I need this.
-Okay.

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:38.902
-Goodness, what's going on?
-It's raining too much.

00:45:39.695 --> 00:45:40.696
Thank you!

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.327
My goodness.

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:08.599
Tae-poong!

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:10.684
Ms. Oh.

00:46:11.518 --> 00:46:13.979
-What brings you here?
-There was so much rain.

00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:16.607
-I was worried, so I came.
-Let's go inside.

00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:22.654
It's locked.

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:25.532
Back up.

00:46:38.003 --> 00:46:38.879
What the heck?

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:40.797
Here's a flashlight.

00:46:41.673 --> 00:46:43.926
-Where's the switch?
-Where is it?

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:45.844
There it is.

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:48.388
Be careful.

00:46:56.396 --> 00:46:57.689
I knew this would happen.

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:02.653
Be careful.

00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:05.614
Damn it!

00:47:09.785 --> 00:47:10.827
Oh, my gosh.

00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:17.834
Oh, no.

00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:21.547
One, two, three.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:24.508
Here.

00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:27.511
Grab it there.

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:31.890
That should do it.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.271
This should work.

00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:41.024
-Did it work?
-Just a minute.

00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:43.402
-Be careful.
-I will.

00:47:44.903 --> 00:47:46.863
-Okay.
-That's good.

00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:48.615
I'll hold the bottom.

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.617
-Pull it down.
-Just a second.

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:51.660
-One second.
-Okay.

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:54.496
-Hold that part.
-Okay.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.165
-I'll go under it, so please pull.
-Okay.

00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:01.378
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:04.881
Watch out!

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:12.055
What happened?

00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:14.057
-We're tangled.
-This isâ€¦

00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:16.560
-Wait a minute.
-Wait.

00:48:16.643 --> 00:48:19.438
-The inside got caught.
-Just tear it.

00:48:19.521 --> 00:48:20.355
My goodness.

00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:22.399
Who's there?

00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:25.319
Tae-poong?

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:28.739
Ms. Oh!

00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:30.991
-Are you okay?
-Tear it.

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.659
-Are you hurt?
-No.

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:33.785
Thank you.

00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:36.121
-What's going on?
-There you go.

00:48:36.204 --> 00:48:37.914
You guys are all here.

00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:39.249
When did you get here?

00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:42.294
We came an hour ago.
We were at the other warehouse.

00:48:43.795 --> 00:48:46.465
This one's even worse.

00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:48.967
What the heck?

00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:51.720
You call this a warehouse?

00:48:51.803 --> 00:48:54.348
Honestly, I knew this would happen.

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.891
Pyo Merchant Marineâ€¦

00:48:55.974 --> 00:48:58.852
They're completely careless.
We should sue them all.

00:49:00.228 --> 00:49:01.480
Those bastards.

00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:05.067
Let's hurry up and do this.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.861
When I catch a cold, it lasts a long time.

00:49:09.154 --> 00:49:10.030
Butâ€¦

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.784
What brings you all here?

00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:17.287
Of course we came.
This is our source of livelihood.

00:49:22.417 --> 00:49:23.919
We don't have time for this.

00:49:24.002 --> 00:49:25.796
-Let's get a move on.
-Yes.

00:49:25.879 --> 00:49:27.047
I'll go over there.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.382
Let's take care of this.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.385
One, two, three.

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:36.890
Here you go.

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:38.850
-It's heavy.
-Put it up here.

00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:41.019
Ready, go!

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.732
-You got it?
-Over here.

00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:47.567
One more.

00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:03.417
Are you okay, Mr. Go?

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.380
-Forget about me. What about you?
-I'm fine.

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:14.219
It's only okay when you're young.

00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:20.600
Once you get older,
your body can't handle it.

00:50:21.935 --> 00:50:24.146
This isn't the best way to do this.

00:50:27.816 --> 00:50:28.859
Be careful.

00:50:30.277 --> 00:50:31.695
Don't hurt yourself.

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:38.702
-We should keep stacking it.
-Okay.

00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:29.878
"Burned it allâ€¦ down to pure white."

00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:34.216
-What?
-Ashita no Joe, by Osamu Dezaki.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.177
Look at that.
The rain stopped once we were done.

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:40.222
I'm so hungry, I can't move.

00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:42.015
Let's go eat.

00:51:42.849 --> 00:51:45.393
What's the date today?

00:51:47.687 --> 00:51:49.856
My goodness! Let's go eat.

00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:51.650
Right now?

00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:53.652
It's 7:00 a.m.

00:51:53.735 --> 00:51:55.070
Don't you guys know?

00:51:55.153 --> 00:51:58.365
At this hour,
it's broad daylight at the port.

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.033
Get up. Let's go.

00:52:00.992 --> 00:52:02.994
Let's just go home.

00:52:03.703 --> 00:52:08.542
We can go home for food.
I have plenty of it.

00:52:16.883 --> 00:52:19.052
I'm actually out of side dishes.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.598
Here we go.

00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:27.561
We had a rough day,
so we need a warm bowl of seaweed soup.

00:52:28.186 --> 00:52:31.231
Give him one with a big piece of meat.

00:52:32.023 --> 00:52:34.943
-It's his birthday, after all.
-Why are you making such a big deal?

00:52:35.026 --> 00:52:37.696
Stop! You're getting sweat everywhere!

00:52:40.073 --> 00:52:42.659
How did you know?

00:52:42.742 --> 00:52:46.329
-Do you know what tomorrow is?
-The company founding anniversary.

00:52:46.413 --> 00:52:50.041
Yes, tomorrow is
our company's founding day.

00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:53.920
It's the day after you were born.
That's when our company opened.

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.089
That's why it's called "Typhoon Trading."

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:01.261
We should at least
raise our glass with water.

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:04.890
-Can't we just eat in peace?
-Come on, guys.

00:53:04.973 --> 00:53:09.019
Happy birthday to our new employee,

00:53:09.102 --> 00:53:12.105
-Kang Tae-poong!
-Cheers.

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.148
Cheers.

00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:18.862
This is a new song
that will be released on January 1st.

00:53:18.945 --> 00:53:23.158
It feels like something
we all need right now.

00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:24.576
Let's take a listen.

00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:33.335
This is delicious.

00:53:58.568 --> 00:53:59.945
It's tasty.

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:01.988
It's good.

00:54:40.193 --> 00:54:41.528
Carry on.

00:54:42.862 --> 00:54:44.197
What are you doing?

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.409
Stop that! Who are you guys?

00:54:48.159 --> 00:54:49.327
Put it in the truck.

00:54:49.911 --> 00:54:53.039
-Let's get a move on, guys!
-Excuse me!

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:54.374
Oh, dear.

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:57.836
I was about to call you.
What brings you here?

00:54:57.919 --> 00:54:59.129
What are you doing?

00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:01.840
We're confiscating the goods
from warehouses 22 and 23.

00:55:01.923 --> 00:55:04.926
-What?
-What are you talking about?

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.261
What the heck is this?

00:55:06.344 --> 00:55:09.472
Stop right there. Put it down!

00:55:09.556 --> 00:55:11.224
-Hey!
-Ms. Cha!

00:55:11.891 --> 00:55:13.643
Ms. Cha!

00:55:13.727 --> 00:55:15.311
What do you think you're doing?

00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:17.814
-Why are you doing this?
-Why, you ask?

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.400
Bring me the contract, Mr. Kim.

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:24.696
I tried to help you guys out,

00:55:24.779 --> 00:55:28.783
but your company hasn't paid
nor retrieved your goods.

00:55:30.285 --> 00:55:34.122
Even with a rough estimate,
there's quite a bit of overdue payment.

00:55:34.205 --> 00:55:36.791
What overdue payment?
We don't owe you anything!

00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:38.835
You're not making any sense.

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:40.670
I'm done talking.

00:55:44.382 --> 00:55:46.885
"Pyo Merchant Marine agrees
to store the goods

00:55:46.968 --> 00:55:49.846
at Warehouses 22 and 23
at the request of Typhoon Trading."

00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:52.015
Exactly. What overdue payment?

00:55:52.098 --> 00:55:54.392
Why do you keep reading that part?

00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:56.436
-Read the back too.
-The back?

00:55:57.562 --> 00:55:59.022
There's a second page?

00:56:02.567 --> 00:56:06.613
"The storage period is up to 72 hours
starting from the request date."

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:08.364
It's been over 72 hours!

00:56:09.324 --> 00:56:12.827
"If you fail to make the repayment or
request an extension within this period,

00:56:12.911 --> 00:56:16.206
the received fabric may be
confiscated and disposed of."

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:19.959
See? I was right.

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.712
-Move everything!
-Yes, sir.

00:56:22.796 --> 00:56:24.089
Let's go, guys.

00:56:24.172 --> 00:56:25.256
Move them!

00:56:28.676 --> 00:56:30.512
Oh, no! What do we do?

00:56:31.304 --> 00:56:34.682
-How could youâ€¦
-No, you can't!

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:36.684
Please wait!

00:56:38.019 --> 00:56:40.438
Please don't!

00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:43.942
-Hurry up!
-Stop it!

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:20.562
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

00:57:20.645 --> 00:57:22.230
Can I help you?

00:57:22.313 --> 00:57:24.482
-What brings you here?
-I'm here to see the CEO.

00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:26.901
Did you make an appointment?
Stop right there!

00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:31.406
-Please stop him.
-Let go of me!

00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:33.908
You can't be here.

00:57:33.992 --> 00:57:35.034
Let go of me!

00:57:35.702 --> 00:57:37.203
I said, let go.

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.663
-He's not here.
-Mr. Pyo!

00:57:38.746 --> 00:57:40.248
What are you doing?

00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:42.834
If you had something to say,
you could've told me.

00:57:42.917 --> 00:57:46.337
I have nothing to say to you.
I just need to talk to Mr. Pyo.

00:57:46.421 --> 00:57:47.964
-Mr. Pyo!
-Take him outside.

00:57:48.047 --> 00:57:49.883
-Mr. Pyo isn't here!
-Let him in.

00:58:00.768 --> 00:58:01.978
Hello, Mr. Pyo.

00:58:02.562 --> 00:58:04.814
I think there's something wrong
with the contract.

00:58:04.898 --> 00:58:07.066
-Could you please take a look?
-You need

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.527
to learn basic business etiquette first.

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:14.032
Who just barges into a CEO's office
without an appointment?

00:58:16.784 --> 00:58:18.411
Apologies, sir. I was in a rush.

00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:20.413
I told you, Dad.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.125
That guy's just an idiot.

00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:28.963
That's why he was out clubbing
while his dad died.

00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:37.472
I'm sorry, sir.
But this contract doesn't make any sense.

00:58:37.555 --> 00:58:41.267
It says here that
there's only a 72-hour storage period,

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:45.939
and unless we make a request, the fabric
could be confiscated or disposed of.

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.315
If this is trueâ€¦

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:50.318
If this is true,
then right from the startâ€¦

00:59:10.088 --> 00:59:11.214
This was a scam.

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.341
Was it?

00:59:15.426 --> 00:59:18.972
I'm just a businessman who saw a profit.
I don't see how that's a scam.

00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:24.018
You should've read the contract carefully
and taken the goods on time.

00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:26.312
Why are you blaming me?

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:31.317
Don't throw a tantrum here
because your company was careless.

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:32.944
This is outrageous.

00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:36.739
This contract is ridiculous.

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:40.535
Let me see the others.

00:59:42.078 --> 00:59:44.122
You crazy bastard.

00:59:44.205 --> 00:59:46.499
Have you lost your mind?
Get him out of here!

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:50.545
Have you seriously lost it? Hey!

00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:56.217
If you touch me right now,

00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:59.220
I'll kill you.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.187
Mr. Pyo!

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.189
This is ridiculous!

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.775
Mr. Pyo! Please show me
the other contracts!

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.944
Mr. Pyo! Let go of me!

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:18.323
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, does it?

01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:35.798
TYPHOON TRADING

01:00:36.382 --> 01:00:39.135
We have no other choice. I'm sorry.

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:41.429
Yes? Who's calling?

01:00:41.512 --> 01:00:42.513
I see.

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:45.099
We're aware, but we're having problems.

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.060
I'll let the director know you called.

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:49.937
I'm afraid we can't pay today.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:53.941
I can't give you an exact date right now.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:58.404
I apologize. I'll call you back.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.031
We're sorry.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:03.660
Hello?

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.245
How many times have you called?

01:01:06.954 --> 01:01:08.539
I told you multiple times.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:12.543
-Hello?
-I don't know where you heard the rumor.

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:16.089
-But it's not true.
-Please don't call me a "bastard," sir.

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.466
I understand your situation, butâ€¦

01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:21.511
It's not like we've gone bankrupt.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.054
-I'll call you back.
-Sue me.

01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:24.555
Sue me, then!

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:26.849
Have you found anyone?

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:30.019
All banks and lenders said no.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.816
How did this happen?

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.245
What are we going to do?

01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:50.248
The rumors have spread about us.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.834
I think we're really going under.

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:56.379
I'm scared they're going to come for us!

01:01:56.462 --> 01:02:00.758
Screw it, tell them to come.
It's over for us anyway.

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:27.910
SAVINGS ACCOUNT
NAME: CHA SEON-TAEK

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.704
They're all under your name.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.873
-My name?
-Yes.

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:49.056
CEO'S OFFICE

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.565
Why are you still here?

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.359
I was just organizing something.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.953
By the way, this is for you.

01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:13.998
Happy birthday.

01:03:22.089 --> 01:03:25.218
It was a tough birthday, wasn't it?

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:27.595
I meanâ€¦

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:29.639
It wasâ€¦

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.683
It was memorable.

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:39.899
-Thank you.
-You worked hard today.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.246
Ta-da!

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:57.500
It's from Brown Bakery cake,
which you like.

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:59.502
I had a hard time getting this.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.798
-Blow out the candle.
-Let's blow it out together.

01:04:03.881 --> 01:04:07.134
-You're right, I earned it.
-Exactly.

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.095
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:12.807
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.851
Open the door!

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:17.061
-Open this door, right now!
-Quiet.

01:04:17.144 --> 01:04:18.646
They'll leave if we're quiet.

01:04:18.729 --> 01:04:20.731
-Mrs. Kang!
-Get out here!

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:22.608
Is no one home?

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.194
Open this door!

01:04:28.489 --> 01:04:29.574
They're gone.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:31.701
Let's eat.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:34.579
Eat up, son. Have some bulgogi.

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:35.663
There's japchae.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.291
Eat up, okay?

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.209
-Mom.
-Yes?

01:04:42.336 --> 01:04:44.505
Should we run away
like Yun-seong's family?

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:50.136
-Somewhere where no one will find us.
-I don't want to.

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.432
I don't want that.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:56.976
But it's scary.

01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:00.605
And sad.

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:02.899
And pathetic.

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:10.281
I may never be called a "madam" again,

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:13.409
but I never want
to be called a bad person.

01:05:14.785 --> 01:05:16.704
It's okay to be a bit pathetic.

01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:21.542
But I don't want to throw away
my integrity, even if I'm poor.

01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:25.338
Your father wasn't like that.

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:33.512
Come on, dig in.
I worked really hard making these.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.514
-Okay.
-Eat up.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:37.600
Have some beef too.

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:43.522
-It's delicious.
-Really?

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:44.607
Yes.

01:05:46.692 --> 01:05:49.111
You're going to eat all that at once?

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:52.949
I can't believe you did that.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.495
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:08.297
Look.

01:06:09.173 --> 01:06:12.176
Can you please stay still?
It's hard to focus.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:15.513
You should pack your belongings too.

01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:20.476
You think I feel happy doing this?

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:25.690
What choice do I have?
My family is running out of food.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.193
I need to do manual labor somewhere.

01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:30.236
What else is there?

01:06:30.861 --> 01:06:32.738
Do you guys have a solution?

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:38.077
-Say something, Mr. Koo!
-Can you please stop, Mr. Go?

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.038
We all feel the same way.
Why do you keep yelling?

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:00.683
Ms. Cha.

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:03.144
-You're done packing too?
-Yes.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:06.564
Ms. Oh.

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:10.443
You should try calling here.
You only need to do the interview.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:11.652
SEYEONG DISTRIBUTION

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:13.821
It's a small distribution company.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.740
But shouldn't weâ€¦

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:20.786
Shouldn't we try
to keep the company going?

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:21.829
Ms. Oh.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:25.291
An employee shouldn't have to do that!

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.504
A company should look after its employees.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:34.759
I need to be able to feed myself,
sleep under a roof,

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.970
and raise my kid.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:42.683
That's how I managed to
get through ten hours at this place.

01:07:44.101 --> 01:07:47.354
When Daebang Textile went down,
it was over for us too.

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:51.525
It's not over yet.

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:57.948
Don't you feel wronged?

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:02.828
Just wait. You can't give up so easily!

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.539
Easily? Does this look easy to you?

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:07.124
All of us here

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:11.462
depend on this company
to put food on the table.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.931
Sure, this is so easy.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.183
Tae-poong.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:28.229
Let's face the facts.
We've all tried our best.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:32.983
And I've worked
in this company for 26 years.

01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:36.987
Sapdari Logistics isn't the only company
we owe money to.

01:08:38.739 --> 01:08:40.491
Can I have that document, Ms. Oh?

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.457
This is the business closure form.

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:51.460
Just submit it at the tax office.

01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:53.921
Go today.

01:08:54.713 --> 01:08:56.507
You never know what could happen.

01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:04.640
Ms. Chaâ€¦

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:13.691
Just in case, disclaim the inheritance.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.695
Look into filing for bankruptcy as well.

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:24.243
Mr. Bae.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.809
We should go too.

01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:28.349
BUSINESS CLOSURE FORM

01:10:36.857 --> 01:10:41.278
JONGNO TAX OFFICE

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:16.689
Rose hip.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:24.571
When people see flower petals falling,

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.032
they say the flowers are withering.

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:29.827
But that's not it.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:33.956
The flowers are trying their best to win

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.750
and bear fruit.

01:12:09.783 --> 01:12:10.701
Thank youâ€¦

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.371
for bearing fruit.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.605
Ongoing instability in financial markets

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:42.775
is stirring uncertainty
in the Korean economy.

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:46.320
Foreign investors continue
to withdraw their capital,

01:12:46.403 --> 01:12:49.573
and the nation's credit rating
is once again under pressure.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.410
Responding to IMF's requirements,
the government made layoffsâ€¦

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:41.125
SEYEONG DISTRIBUTION

01:13:55.389 --> 01:14:02.354
RESUME
NAME: OH MI-SEON

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.916
Where is she?

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.686
Tae-poong?

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:46.273
Is that you, Tae-poong?

01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:48.734
Tae-poong!

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:52.863
What are you doing here?
Look at your face.

01:14:54.114 --> 01:14:57.784
-Did you walk all the way here?
-Thank goodness.

01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:01.705
I was worried you'd be asleep.

01:15:01.788 --> 01:15:04.333
Why are you here at this hour?
It's freezing.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.503
I wanted to say something.

01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:09.963
Did you

01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:13.800
file for business closure?

01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:18.263
Don't go to the interview tomorrow.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:19.806
Pardon?

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:21.558
I have something for you.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:38.951
I went to the tax office

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:42.162
and applied
for a change of representative.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:46.375
They said I need to provide
a payment guarantee.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.297
TYPHOON TRADING
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:59.054
You're the CEO now.

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:00.889
Yes.

01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:05.602
I just became

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:08.230
the CEO now.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:11.316
But I have no employeesâ€¦

01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:15.112
or any moneyâ€¦

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:19.491
or any things to sell.

01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:22.828
But what I'm trying to say is,

01:16:25.205 --> 01:16:26.206
Ms. Oh Mi-seonâ€¦

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.507
Will you come and workâ€¦

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.094
for Typhoon Tradingâ€¦

01:16:41.471 --> 01:16:42.806
as a trader?

01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:08.415
Yes.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:47.245
MOONLIGHT IN SEOUL

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:23.532
TYPHOON FAMILY

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:25.659
I want to visit this place in person.

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:27.244
-Mr. Kang Tae-poong?
-There she is.

01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:29.746
You'll find any currency here.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.124
I'm Park Yun-cheol, the CEO of Shoe Park.

01:18:32.999 --> 01:18:35.794
And fivefold if we sell it at 50,000 won.

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:38.380
Why don't you
just hand over the company to me?

01:18:38.463 --> 01:18:40.716
There must be something important
at Typhoon Trading.

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:42.426
Take this and cancel the agreement.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.594
I got these at a dirt-cheap price
for paying up front--

01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:46.096
Kang Tae-poong!

01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:48.014
You'd be better off
staying out of the business.

01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:49.808
People never change.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:52.144
It's fun.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:54.730
Do you feel confident?

01:18:55.772 --> 01:19:00.777
