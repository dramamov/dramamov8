WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.586
He's no longer in the hospital,
and you're still visiting him?

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.507
Just so you can be with my, husband.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.634
Ingrid?

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.971
There's nothing
I hate more than a traitor!

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:16.307
And now, the last one I'll go after.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.184
Mia's in danger.
Ma'am Olivia was murdered.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.228
Take her to Manila or some province!

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.063
-She needs to be safe!
-I'll take care of Mia.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.357
Patrick! Matmat's alone in the mansion!

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.127
Hello, Matmat.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.048
You are…

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:32.592
Y-You are Ma'am Eden?

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:38.431
How are you, Matmat?

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:43.812
Patpat told me
to stay away from Ma'am Eden.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.109
P-Please don't!

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:57.408
Butterfly!

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:01.371
-If I find out…
-Matmat, run!

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.997
…I will kill you!

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.336
Butterfly!

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.421
An evil butterfly!

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.175
Ah!

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.145
That reporter earlier?

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.022
Send her a gift, anything.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.648
She was kind to Matmat.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.860
Okay. I'll tell Madeth.

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:20.992
How come Matmat
isn't joining our meeting?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.041
It's for a new endorsement.
And…

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.919
Apparently, they only want to meet you.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.799
Liar.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.011
Tell me what's wrong.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.514
Wrong? What's-- There's nothing wrong.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.225
There's nothing
wrong with the endorsement.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.560
You're like a
seven-year-old kid in a toy store

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.854
whenever I get a new endorsement.

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.732
You can't stop talking about it.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.443
And I'm talking about it now.

00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:56.694
Vincent, you know me.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.529
Do not lie to me.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.323
Tell me.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.367
Where are you taking me?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.789
-I said, where are you taking me?!
-Mia, stop!

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.499
Stop it, Mia!

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.834
Mia, please!
I'm taking you to the airport!

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.920
I'm taking you back to Manila,
away from here!

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.297
Away from here? Why?

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.049
Because of my mom?

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.051
Vincent, I'm not afraid of her.

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:22.595
Mia, your life's in danger.
She killed Ma'am Olivia.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.848
Patrick asked me
to take you away from here!

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.600
Who killed her?

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:28.768
My mother?

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.311
I don't know!

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.022
How about Matmat?

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.190
Where are they?

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.276
I will not leave without them!

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.529
Patrick said he'd pick
up Matmat at the mansion.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.571
-That's it.
-No.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.031
-No--Mia!
-Go back!

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.450
-I don't know Patrick's plan!
-I said, turn around!

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.493
Mia, stop it!

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:47.704
-I said, turn around!
-I don't know his plan!

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.330
He asked me to take you somewhere!

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:52.041
-He'll take care of Matmat!
-You're ganging up on me!

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.544
Of course not!
We're trying to protect you!

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.004
Mia, stop it!

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.215
Turn around, or else…

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.508
No! No!

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:01.759
I swear, Vincent.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.262
If anything happens to Patrick and Matmat,

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.388
to my family,

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.140
you and I are over!

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.769
Mia, please! Mia, stop it!

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.855
Mia!

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.812
Have you lost your mind?!
I'm doing this for your sake--

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.355
Don't be stupid, Mia!

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.607
Mia, please!

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.941
Mia!

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.276
Mia!

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.278
Mia, don't do this!
You're life is in danger!

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.405
I'm doing this for your safety!

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.324
Get some sense! Mia!

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:08.242
Mia, stop the car!

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.494
Mia!

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.225
Hello, Matmat.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.186
Matmat, Patrick and
I are heading back there!

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:43.402
Hello, my daughter.

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:47.824
Mama?

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.118
Yes. I'm back!

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.829
Where is Matmat?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.749
Aw, very sweet of you.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.544
Caring for a person other than yourself!

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.546
Where is Matmat?

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:04.465
I can see that you've forgotten.

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:08.094
My dear daughter, always remember

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.346
no one else matters but yourself.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.309
What have you done to him?!

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.687
You want to see him?

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.440
Then come home, darling.

00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:22.817
I will be waiting for you.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.604
Matmat?

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.814
Matmat!

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:02.857
Matmat!

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:07.904
Ingrid.

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:10.072
Matmat!

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.580
You will pay for everything you did.

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.874
Are you going to call the police?

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.628
As if they can stop me.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.215
Go ahead.

00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:33.471
There's a lot more
I can do before they arrive.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:37.308
Hmm?

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.352
Phone.

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:42.396
Phone.

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:45.191
Phone.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:55.910
Matmat?

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.038
Matmat?

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.542
What did you do to him?

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:05.461
Relax.

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:07.421
He's just sleeping.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:10.007
I just want to see
the terror on your face.

00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:16.305
What more do you want?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.141
What more do I want? Hmm…

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.354
I want you, gone.

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:24.897
Both of you.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.109
Oh, no?

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.071
Fine.

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:33.698
I'll give you three options.

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:36.826
First, leave.

00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:40.037
Never show your faces around Mia again.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.914
Get far away from her.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:45.042
-Just leave my daughter alone.
-We won't leave Mia.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.877
Option two…

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.173
…kill me.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.220
Not only will
you avenge your mother's death,

00:09:57.305 --> 00:10:01.934
but once Mia sees me dead,
she'll be so broken

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.728
that she'll go back to her old self.

00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:08.149
What do you say?

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:18.451
I'm doing neither of those.

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:20.578
Mia and I have accepted our pasts.

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:21.912
So leave her alone!

00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:25.916
Then that leaves us
with option number three.

00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:29.462
Die!

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.382
You and your brother die!

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.303
Hmm?

00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:41.432
But, aw, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:46.646
That is just way too easy, no?

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:49.148
Like where's the fun in that?

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.108
Fun?

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.735
You think it's fun to kill people?

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.195
Well, it might as well be!

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.949
Is it better than to worry
about you getting in my way?

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.409
Yes!

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.913
The both of you are
ruining my daughter's life!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.750
How is that possible
when all we've done is love Mia?

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.877
Who said you could do that?!

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.421
Who said that?!

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:15.716
Stupid.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.926
Stupid!

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:21.806
You and your mother are both stupid!

00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:28.437
Oh, that's an idea.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:32.108
Ooh… Bright!

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.401
What if…

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.030
I do to you,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.617
what I did to your mother?

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.245
Hmm?

00:11:45.913 --> 00:11:47.289
Hmm…

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.376
What did you do to Mama? Huh?

00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:57.007
You don't know?

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.593
Your mother died…

00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:02.680
because of Mia.

00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:05.349
Aw…

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.524
I want
to send Mia to a writing camp.

00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:17.403
Or any other workshop she wants.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:19.989
What for?

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.160
So she'll meet new people?

00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:25.786
Make new playmates?

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:27.746
New friends.

00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:33.377
Her teacher said she's not
close with any of her classmates.

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:36.922
If Mia can't make friends at school,

00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:40.551
what makes you think she will elsewhere?

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.929
A new place equals new people.

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:47.308
What matters is
we expose Mia to new things.

00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:49.143
We also need
to get her assessed by a doctor--

00:12:49.226 --> 00:12:52.521
There's nothing wrong, with my child.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.235
Good afternoon.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.572
Sir Samuel, I'm done cleaning.

00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:02.823
Ah, yes.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.575
Uh, Ingrid?

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:09.121
This is Tessie, our new housekeeper.

00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:11.499
She won't be staying with us.

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.627
Good afternoon, ma'am.

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.760
Um, Tessie,

00:13:23.427 --> 00:13:27.097
Could you make Mia
a snack for after school?

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.058
You can go home after you're done.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.768
Thank you, sir.

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:48.452
Mia, are you okay?

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.749
Oh, what's that?

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:00.631
-Oh…
-No!

00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:02.883
Leave it alone.

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:06.095
The poor thing could still be alive.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.515
Its wing is hurt, it won't be able to fly.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.892
Just let it die.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.644
Mia!

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.357
Or I can end its suffering.

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.028
Mia, my dear,

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:26.156
every creature's life is important.

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.826
Why do you want to kill it?

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:40.129
Mia?

00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:43.424
Sir…Good day, sir.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.770
Uh, Mia? Sweetie?

00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:59.064
Go inside, dear.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.866
I'm sorry if my
daughter comes across as strange.

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.703
Sir, if you don't mind me asking,

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.705
is Mia a special child?

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:18.250
I want to have
her checked by a specialist,

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.710
but Ingrid doesn't want to.

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:22.963
I think Mia and my
youngest son are the same age.

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:24.924
If it's okay with you,

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:27.801
I can bring my kids
here to play with Mia.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.721
[unsettling music continues

00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.224
Thank you, Tessie.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.523
-Could you give me a hand?
-Oh, yes, sir.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:51.825
You can take these
extra crops for your kids.

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.661
Sir, this is too much.

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:55.329
But, thank you.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.169
Sorry I took so long.

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.546
It took forever…

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.882
to clean the room of my boss's daughter.

00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:12.096
Let's go, Patpat.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.150
Watch your step.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.819
Yes, Mama!

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:28.070
Mama!

00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:31.657
Go ahead, I'll catch up later.

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:35.828
Alright, don't take long.

00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:38.789
Don't take long, Patpat! Don't take long!

00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:40.541
Come on. Be careful.

00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:41.875
P-Patpat!

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.642
Matmat!

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.776
Your children left you.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.196
Ma'am Ingrid.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.865
What are you doing out here?

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:17.244
I just want to talk to you.

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:18.620
What?

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:19.705
Why?

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:23.959
How long have you been
fooling around with my husband?

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.546
Ma'am, what are you saying?

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:29.006
-Don't lie!
-Ouch!

00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:30.466
You are Samuel's mistress!

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:31.884
No, I am not!

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:33.844
He gave you fruits.

00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:38.223
That means you get all the extra crops!

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:41.226
Ma'am, that was only one time.
Please let me go.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.728
You're the one he's hiding in that hut?

00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:44.688
No, ma'am!

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:50.152
He wants Mia to be
friends with your sons?

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:51.862
Ma'am, no, it's not--

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:55.282
Your dirty, filthy boys

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.868
with my precious baby girl?

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:00.621
Ma'am, I'm not having
relationship with Sir Samuel!

00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:02.164
I'm telling the truth!

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:04.333
-Please let me go--
-I hate it…

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:07.795
when someone takes away what's mine!

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:09.171
Ma'am, please stop!

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:12.299
Mama?

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:14.802
Mama!

00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:17.429
Mama!

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:20.224
Mama!

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:22.684
-Ma'am, ma'am…
-Mama!

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.645
I'm begging you.

00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:26.980
Please don't hurt my son.

00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:29.066
Are you going to confess,

00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:30.776
or do you want me to hurt him?

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:33.278
Ma'am, please don't hurt my son.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.447
-I'm begging you!
-Mama?

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.282
-Last chance!
-Ma'am!

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.952
-Please don't hurt my son.
-Are you…

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:43.247
the woman my husband is seeing?

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:47.417
Ma'am, please don't hurt my son!

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.729
Mama?

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:10.816
M-Matmat…

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:12.609
That's what you deserve…

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.654
…for meddling with my daughter.

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:20.200
Especially for
trying to steal my husband!

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:21.201
Matmat…

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:23.537
Ma'am…

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.387
Did you see what happened?

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.472
Mm-hmm.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.105
You will not tell anyone.

00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:51.773
Okay?

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:52.941
Mm-hmm.

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:57.613
If I find out…

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.365
that you told anyone,

00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:03.660
I will kill you!

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:06.955
No matter where you go…

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:10.584
I will find you!

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:12.002
And I will make sure…

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:16.381
that I will kill you!

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.634
Matmat, run!

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:21.094
-Answer me!
-I don't want to!

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:23.931
I don't want to!
I don't want to!

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:27.351
I don't want to! I don't want to!

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:29.394
I don't want to!

00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:54.586
Are you here to see my daughter?

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:09.226
Stay away from Mia.

00:21:09.309 --> 00:21:13.647
And never let me see
you here in my mansion again!

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.302
Matmat?

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.095
-Where's Mama?
-Mama!

00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:46.596
Mama!

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.890
Mama!

00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:51.393
-Mama!
-Where is she, Matmat?

00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:55.522
Mama!

00:21:55.605 --> 00:21:58.650
The butterfly! The butterfly!

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.777
-Mama!
-She's going to come back!

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:02.487
Mama!

00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:08.952
You killed my mother
because she gave you advice?

00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:11.455
Because she kept meddling!

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:16.501
You see, my daughter is my work of art--

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:17.919
You monster!

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.171
You monster!

00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:20.589
You killed my mother!

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:21.673
Monster!

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.634
Go ahead…

00:22:24.968 --> 00:22:27.137
Do it!

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.057
Go on, kill me.

00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:34.019
-Kill me!
-Monster!

00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:38.106
Show Mia that you're not weak!

00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:39.900
Kill me!

00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:57.209
Oh, Patrick…

00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:00.545
My good son.

00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:03.173
You'll realize it soon.

00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:05.092
I love you so much.

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:36.706
You're a weak kind of man, Patrick.

00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:40.585
You don't deserve my daughter.

00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:42.838
Patrick!

00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:48.885
You bitch!

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:49.970
No, Mia!

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:53.849
Don't hurt her.

00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:56.393
Patrick.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.061
You're not…

00:23:58.728 --> 00:24:00.021
You're not a monster.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.357
-Patrick, Patrick!
-Mia…

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.441
Patrick!

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:06.528
Patrick!

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:09.948
You're not like your mother.

00:24:10.031 --> 00:24:11.408
No!

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:13.618
Patrick!

00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:15.453
No!

00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:17.330
Patrick.

00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:18.915
My lovely daughter.

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.710
Is that how you greet your mother?

00:24:22.502 --> 00:24:24.045
Don't call me that.

00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:26.798
I'm not your daughter anymore.

00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:31.011
You ungrateful bitch!

00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:34.514
I gave you everything.

00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:41.563
Your success, your very being!

00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:44.399
You are my blood!

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:45.942
You are me!

00:24:51.698 --> 00:24:53.909
I chose my destiny.

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:56.286
You have nothing to do with it!

00:24:56.369 --> 00:24:57.579
Destiny?

00:25:02.959 --> 00:25:04.586
You may not have seen it,

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:08.298
but I gave you everything!

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:12.510
You got into the University of Marlowe…

00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:14.804
because of me!

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.016
You were accepted by the publishing house

00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:19.643
because of my name!

00:25:22.103 --> 00:25:24.814
I paved the way for your success!

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:27.067
All because of me!

00:25:28.568 --> 00:25:30.987
I don't need fame and success.

00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:32.489
Because I'm not like you.

00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:34.574
Never will be.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:38.870
I will never be anything like you.

00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:47.462
You think you can escape me?

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:49.506
Just because you cut your hair?

00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:52.509
You can never get away from me.

00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:55.804
My blood runs through you.

00:25:57.555 --> 00:26:01.226
Mia, you have been such a very bad girl.

00:26:02.602 --> 00:26:04.396
You did not listen to Mama.

00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:10.151
Did I not tell
you to stay away from that boy?

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:13.238
Now, look what happened!

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.330
Sir, can you please hurry?

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:34.843
Now…

00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:42.183
I will write the perfect ending for us.

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:43.310
You and me both.

00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:45.979
We will conquer the world, Mia.

00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:49.774
Say, "Yes, Mama."

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.360
Say it.

00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:54.612
"Yes, Mama."

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:55.947
Say it!

00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:58.408
"Yes, Mama!"

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:02.329
I would rather die…

00:27:03.496 --> 00:27:05.415
than become like you.

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:09.419
I hate you!

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.568
You played with so many people.

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.945
I did everything for my daughter.

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:37.280
That's how I show my love.

00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:39.866
You will pay for all
the wrong you've done.

00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:43.953
I used to hate butterflies
because they reminded me of you.

00:27:44.037 --> 00:27:46.664
Patpat, I wish you were here.

00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:48.666
Our family will be okay.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:52.087
Butterflies are for healing.
