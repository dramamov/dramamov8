00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.799
You Azure Dragon Gang

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.079
Have you had any enemies lately?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.280
I got it.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.799
I got it.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.000
Are you kidding me?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.799
Aren't you?

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.000
I already know.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.120
Stop pretending.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.799
Not funny.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400
Not funny at all.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.599
Get up.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.319
Wake up.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.359
Get up.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.200
So boring.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.760
Keep this up and I'll kill you, believe it or not.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.599
Get up.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:36.599
Believe I'll do this to you—

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:37.000
Yuer

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.239
Yuer, calm down.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:39.200
Let go.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.560
It's all your fault.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.599
It's because of you.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.640
If it hadn't been for you back then—

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.400
Leaving without a word—

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319
I wouldn't have founded the Azure Dragon Gang.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.799
If I hadn't started the Azure Dragon Gang,

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.280
the brothers wouldn't have died.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.000
They wouldn't have died.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.280
I understand now.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.120
We're in this together.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.000
You all teamed up to trick me.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:13.680
I know now.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.439
Get up.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.879
Hurry, get up.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.039
Is there surveillance here?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.560
Yes.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.120
Who is this person?

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.680
Shen Jingshi

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.800
I knew this

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.120
was tied to the Shen family.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.000
Who is Shen Jingshi?

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.080
The only heir of the Shen family.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.520
But I heard this person

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.599
doesn't have any Power.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:02.280
Where are you going?

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.919
I'm going to bring Ade back.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.680
Find Shen Jingshi and avenge our brothers.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.400
We don't stand a chance.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.599
We need another helper.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.280
For what?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.000
To find your young lady.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.800
Open the door.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.039
Sorry.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.759
No unauthorized entry.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.479
What's wrong?

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.560
You don't even recognize me now?

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.960
The master instructed us.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.680
Especially the Jia family's young lady.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.800
No entry allowed.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.199
If that's the case,

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.280
she can't go in,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.599
does that mean I can?

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.400
You count as unauthorized.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.360
You—

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.199
Fine.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.080
Then we won't go in.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.879
Go get Tang Yuyan out here.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.400
Tell her I'm waiting at the door.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.400
The young lady isn't feeling well.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.199
She's resting.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.280
Can't see guests.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280
You really won't budge, huh?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.680
I don't care, I'm going in.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.960
Sorry.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.159
The master instructed us.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.520
Please don't make things hard for us.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.960
What if I refuse?

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.919
Sorry, Miss Jia.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We don't want this either.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.919
Please leave.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.480
I don't buy it.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.959
The master instructed us.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.600
Please don't interfere with my work.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.000
Please leave now.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.720
The master will be back soon.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.000
It's strange,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.199
I could always enter the Tang house before.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:36.480
Why is Madam Tang

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.800
not letting me see Yuyan today?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.839
Second Uncle said yesterday

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.600
Madam Tang sent us back.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:42.800
Did you see it?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.199
Is Jin Zhenghao dead?

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.000
Then Shen Tianyi came with people.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.519
Jin Zhenghao was killed by him.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.560
Then he knocked me out too.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.399
I don't remember anything after that.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.480
Feels like your Power has grown.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.120
You can control more people at once.

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:04.639
But why do you always

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.720
have to bring Xiaoduo with you?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.600
You can't even take care of yourself.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.800
Why not leave her with my second uncle?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Don't do that.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.000
Your uncle's a middle-aged playboy.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.199
If you really leave her with him,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.759
he's never home.

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:17.079
Who'd look after Xiaoduo?

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.879
But it's tiring for her to run with us.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.759
Besides,

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.000
she can't really help.

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.600
She's mad.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.879
What did she say?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.000
Probably cursed pretty badly.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:40.519
Who is it?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.720
Who is it?

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.879
Let me tell you something.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:52.800
No matter who you are,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.000
open the door for me right now.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.879
Did you hear me?

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:55.839
Don't think that staying silent

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:56.800
means I don't know who you are.

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:57.959
Once I get out of here,

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.600
I'll check the cameras to see who you are.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.040
Who would've thought our Miss Tang

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.879
would go out wearing a mask.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.600
Jia Yuer, sis.

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.120
Miss, we're here to rescue you.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:12.759
We—

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:14.519
Meng Yan is here too.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.800
Yuyan, I'm here.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.199
My mom locked the door from outside.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.120
I can't get out.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.199
Can't you control shadows?

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.639
My mom took away all the lights

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.600
from inside here.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.680
No shadows can appear.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.000
Do the servants have a key?

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.399
I don't know.

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:32.600
Hey!

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:33.720
What are you doing?

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.600
We're here to pick someone up,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.000
not to kidnap anyone.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.959
Then what do you suggest?

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.720
Let's split up and search.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.519
Check if any other servants

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:45.680
have a spare key.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.000
The Tang house is so big,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and there are so many servants.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.759
If you check one by one,

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:50.800
Madam Tang will be back by then.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.079
Stop wasting time.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.959
Don't fire a gun in someone else's house.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.120
Can't help it—it's for survival.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.160
Jia Yuer.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.600
Meng Yan.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.560
Why are you all here?

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.079
Yuyan.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.560
Something happened to the Azure Dragon Gang.

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:21.879
What happened?

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.639
Madam.

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:36.840
I only remember that kid

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.559
came with the Jia family's young lady.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.159
There was another girl with them.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.600
I just remember they tried to force their way in.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.559
We kept trying to stop them.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:45.879
But what happened after that,

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:47.200
I can't remember at all.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.320
I failed in my duty.

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:49.600
Please punish me, Madam.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.279
We've been busy in the house all along,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.279
but we really didn't see them at all.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.679
It's really strange.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:58.720
Forget it.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:01.039
It's not your fault.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:17.679
Madam Tang.

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:18.679
Mr. Shen.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.759
What brings you here?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.919
I'd like to ask Madam Tang

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.879
if you're planning to take Meng Yan—

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:30.200
I don't know where he is.

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:33.679
Yuyan should know, right?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.519
He took Yuyan away.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.399
If you run into him, Mr. Shen,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.440
please tell him to stay away from Yuyan.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:46.480
Sorry to bother you, Madam Tang.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.159
Prepare the car. We're going to the Jia family.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.559
Yes, Madam.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.000
Uncle.

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.519
All of this is part of my plan.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:06.799
If I can defeat Jin Zhenghao,

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:11.759
he's not as weak as you think.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.279
I'll definitely bring him back alive.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.679
Mianhuatang, come here.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.200
This is where I live.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.759
It's a bit small,

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:38.000
but it should fit all of us.

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.039
No—

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.840
You both have such big houses,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.360
so why do you insist on

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.440
having your own little space?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.600
Nonsense.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.519
What girl

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.879
doesn't have her own little secrets?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.159
Xiao Duo.

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:54.240
You're still young.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.399
If anything happens, you have to tell your brother.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.080
Don't lie to me.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.879
Do you hear me?

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.480
You know,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.159
you're not that old,

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:03.279
but you sure act like a dad.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.399
You—

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.720
Xiao Duo.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.159
We need to talk about something.

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:10.519
Go to the bedroom first.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:11.960
Play with Mianhuatang for a while, okay?

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:13.519
Come on, over here.

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:23.200
Madam Tang.

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:24.879
Step aside.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.360
Sorry, Madam Tang.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.000
Our master is already resting.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.000
What if I insist on going in?

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.519
One zero two.

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.200
The Tang family head is forcing her way in.

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:39.039
Request immediate backup.
