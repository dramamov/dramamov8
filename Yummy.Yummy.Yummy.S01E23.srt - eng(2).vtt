♪Better and better♪

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.550
Fengxia.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.640
Fengxia.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.760
What are you doing?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.780
All the dishes are served.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.990
I have to cook dumplings.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.680
Previously I bought you a carriage.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.480
You didn't like it.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.400
You scolded me for it.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.960
Before that, I bought you a ring,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.870
but the size was wrong.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.880
You scolded me again.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.160
Today,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.350
I bought you another ring
to make up for it.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.600
I hope you can stop scolding me.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.710
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.220
(Pavilion of Jade in the Fairy Mountains)

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.710
Your Highness,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.590
it's getting late.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.040
How about

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.750
I go back first?

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.960
So I won't delay you
entering the palace.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.400
Her Highness understands
that you have no time to return home,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.690
and that spending Chinese New Year's Eve

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.200
alone away from home must be difficult,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.910
so Her Highness declined
other invitations

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.620
and invited you to be here
for a gathering.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.140
The news

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.670
that I couldn't afford the travel fare

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.220
to return home

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.540
has somehow reached you.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.420
I just feel

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.260
that entering the palace
is even more boring.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.260
It's better to stay here

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.540
and enjoy tea and chess
with a close friend.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.220
There are even night outings
during the festival.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.620
I haven't been to a lantern festival
in many years.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.420
How about you come along

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.460
with me?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.300
It's a copper coin.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.220
Impressive.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.980
- You got it.
- I got a copper coin.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.340
Does eating a copper coin

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.340
mean

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.300
that in the Chinese New Year

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.780
I can have whatever I want?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.620
Yes.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.660
So what do you want for the Chinese New Year?

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.420
Grandpa,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.420
wishing you prosperity.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.500
Give me money.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.300
Good girl.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.140
Sure.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.500
I've already prepared it for you.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.350
Here, take it.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.260
Thank you, grandpa.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.380
Grandma, wishing you prosperity.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.340
Give me money.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.140
I forgot today. What should I do?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.500
She feels wronged.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.180
I've already prepared it
for a long time.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.020
Thank you, grandma.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.100
You're welcome.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.340
Happy Chinese New Year, Auntie.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.060
Happy Chinese New Year, Yangyang.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.180
Thank you, Auntie.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.700
Deyuan.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.820
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.900
It's mine?

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.780
Of course.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.460
You're also part of our family.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.060
Thank you, milady.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.060
Ming, look.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.980
Mr. Lin.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.940
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.580
I'm really not prepared.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.780
Take it all.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.500
That's a lot.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.580
Mr. Lin, this is way too much.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.740
Including the share for me
and Liu Chang.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.260
It's not much.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.420
Here, take it.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.740
Yangyang, you should give Mr. Lin
a kowtow for this.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.460
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.420
May everything go smoothly.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.610
- This kid.
- Go ahead.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.820
Yangyang.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.740
Look, what is this?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.580
This is...

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.780
This is the lucky money from my father.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.540
My father even sent a letter.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.570
Here, take it.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.060
Let's open it and read.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.900
This is written by Gongcai.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.100
Let me see.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.940
Here.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.180
This is really written by Gongcai.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.460
Let me read it to everyone.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.020
Family members,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.220
when you read this letter,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.500
I am already on my way

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.820
to the peak.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.340
Don't worry.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.860
With my personal charm,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.740
wherever I am,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.020
I will be warmly sought after.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.220
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.640
this kind of talk show

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.500
is probably something
you haven't heard before.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.900
You shamelessly dragged us here.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.280
Didn't you say you don't want money

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.540
and you provide tea and snacks?

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.540
Where is the stuff? Where is it?

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.180
Where is the stuff you promised?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.740
Everyone, calm down.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.900
I'll definitely provide.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.180
But if

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.580
you think I speak quite well,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.300
I still hope everyone can offer me

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.180
a couple of coins.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.420
That's him.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.380
I saw him nearby yesterday.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.020
He talked about gender equality;

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.880
ladies should be independent
and self-reliant.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.580
He even asked my wife divorce me.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.370
He mislead the public.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.210
- I didn't.
- Is that so?

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.740
- Hit him.
- Beat him to death.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.940
Hit him.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.020
Don't run.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.730
Stop!

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.520
Stop!

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.430
Don't run.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.340
I'm all good.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.620
I just miss Yangyang.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.900
Yangyang,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.860
you are the daughter
I am most proud of.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.140
In the future you must be like me...

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.700
- Become...
- Perform or not?

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.820
- Think much.
- Very soon.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.660
Be enterprising.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.020
Innovative.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.980
I once had a large number of fans

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.460
in Yong'an,

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.380
and achieved some small successes.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.460
But I never became complacent
about it;

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.660
instead, I keep seeking

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.100
new entrepreneurial directions.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.020
Life is just like this,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.300
full of possibilities.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.020
Yangyang,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.940
you know what?

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.980
My current job is very good.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.460
High income,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.860
decent,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.220
stable.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.900
When dealing with colleagues at work,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.900
I have always approached

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.960
with an attitude of cooperation
and mutual benefit.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.220
So,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.220
I can easily

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.180
get along with everyone.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.580
You don't need to worry about me.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.780
Awesome!

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.500
Are you going to fight or not?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.580
- Hurry up.
- Exactly.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.540
Do it quickly.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.420
Do it!

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.660
Don't just stand there watching.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.860
Hit him.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.020
Do it.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.860
Didn't you eat?

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.300
Didn't you eat?

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.500
OK.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.900
I'm telling you,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.500
you can hit me anywhere you want,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.940
just not the face.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.020
Otherwise my female fans

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.900
will be unhappy.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.180
Awesome!

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.420
It's almost Chinese New Year.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.740
Wish my family a Happy Chinese New Year.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.580
If there are any other developments,

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.900
I will write again to inform you.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.620
May you all be safe and sound.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.500
Do not miss me.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.260
Applause.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.700
- Give him applause.
- Great.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.500
Gongcai has finally grown.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:16.940
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.740
Yangyang, you should be happy.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.580
Isn't it?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.180
Come on.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.220
Let's keep eating.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.700
Let me tell you all.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.900
There are quite a few good omens
in these dumplings.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.540
Let's see what each of you can get.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.990
Come on, start eating.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.900
Alright, let's eat.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.740
OK.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.340
Come on, Mr. Lin.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.860
Try this filling.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.380
Thank you.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.220
You're welcome.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.440
By the way, there's one more thing
I want to announce.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.460
Our restaurant's renovation

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.940
will be finished soon.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.820
It will be ready to open
after the Chinese New Year.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.700
- Great.
- Great.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.820
Come on, everyone, eat up.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.860
Let's eat.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.220
Let's eat.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.740
Auspicious Chinese New Year.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.540
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.740
(Miss You in Yong'an)
The Princess has arrived.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.540
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.660
Today is Chinese New Year's Eve.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.520
No need to be constrained
by these formalities.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.140
Are you about to go out?

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.460
Censor Pei and I

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.900
just finished admiring the lanterns.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.740
I was thinking of coming to your place
for some hotpot.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.220
Looks like this is bad timing, huh?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.060
No, Yangyang wants
to go see the lanterns.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.940
My father and mother

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.120
have already taken them there.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.460
I'm not interested in those things.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.300
It's alright.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.420
Deyuan.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.480
You've been talking
about Aoshan Lanterns all day.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.580
You catch up with them.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.290
Deyuan, go ahead.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.220
I will stay with your lady.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.900
Liu Chang is here too.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.740
It's OK.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.860
Your Highness,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.780
please take a seat.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.420
Please.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.020
The newly heated Tusu wine.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.660
Drink some first to warm up.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.220
Lady Shen,

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.060
the tofu from your restaurant
is quite peculiar.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.580
I have never seen it before.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.020
Why are there so many holes?

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.140
Cut the tofu into square cubes,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.340
and blanch with salt,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.820
then holes will form and expand.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.730
After placing it in the ice cellar
to freeze,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.550
it will be like this.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.780
Put it into the soup.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.100
It will be especially flavorful.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.660
Truly delicious.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.660
Delicious.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.220
I'm glad you like it.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.060
Lady Shen,

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.980
today, regardless of status,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.340
why not sit down with us?

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.780
Let's drink and sing together,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.420
and have a lively time.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.380
Then thank you, Your Highness.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.460
Here.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.540
Auspicious Chinese New Year.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.900
Mr. Lin,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.220
your alcohol tolerance is poor.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.580
Better drink a little less.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.940
OK.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.780
Lady Shen,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.460
you said Anran

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.550
has poor alcohol tolerance?

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.820
His alcohol tolerance...

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.580
Anran,

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.140
could it be

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.300
that you lied to Lady Shen?

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.740
Twelfth Master,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.160
what nonsense are you talking about?

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.580
Is it nonsense?

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.820
I did hear

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.380
you can hold your liquor
without getting drunk.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.730
That time, Second Master Huan

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.660
somehow offended you.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.500
His uncle hosted a banquet
and invited you.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.580
He said

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.940
you drank all of their Jiannan Wine,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.700
still without changing your expression.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.860
It's all old news.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.180
Don't mention it.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.820
Mr. Lin, I'm sorry, I was wrong.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.880
- Lady Shen.
- I dare not.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.340
What happened last night?

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.940
I can't remember.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.020
Last night we ate moon cakes together.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.940
I became a listener.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
Then we had a drink together.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.980
After that,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.820
I can't remember clearly.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.300
Did something bad happen?

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:50.980
Lady Shen,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.180
this is also Jiannan wine, very strong.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.500
You shouldn't drink like that.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.740
You will be...

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.770
Your alcohol tolerance isn't good.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.700
Yes.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.030
I'm not good at holding my liquor.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.380
Unlike you,

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.420
you remember everything.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.020
Around the Lantern Festival,

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.020
I am going to hold a few banquets.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.300
I'll entrust them to you.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.220
What do you think?

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.620
I appreciate it, Your Highness.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.860
Censor Pei,

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.020
truly delicious.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.140
Lady Shen, please don't mind.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.460
I'm just curious

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.460
about frozen tofu.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.580
I'm curious
about how frozen tofu is made.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.700
I am so happy

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.180
that you like it.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.180
How could I mind?

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.540
Please have a look.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.780
So this is frozen tofu.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.860
Where is that?

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.020
That's our warehouse,

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.060
where some commonly used ingredients
are stored.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.340
May I go and take a look?

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.060
Mainly, I just want to see

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.940
if there are any suitable ingredients
for the banquet.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.620
Of course.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.180
Your Highness, please.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.420
Light the candles first.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:01.940
Your Highness.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.540
Your Highness.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.060
What are you looking for?

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.140
Crowbar.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.000
I don't know

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.300
if Her Highness misunderstand us.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.160
If we keep staying,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.220
it's not a solution.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.900
You're afraid to stay with me?

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.940
I am not.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.950
Her Highness likes to play a trick.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.540
If we go out right now,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.200
it seems as if we are quite displeased,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.860
hurting her feelings.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.220
Let's wait a while.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.180
Once upon a time in Qingyang,

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.100
did your family also eat
water-shield dumplings?

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.620
My family actually didn't eat it much.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.460
So you made a special trip?

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.780
There's not much I can do.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.620
We're family.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.100
I just made something you like to eat,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.740
so it can cheer you up a bit.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.220
No matter what happens,

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.660
as long as there are people
who will always support you,

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.180
you will surely get through it.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.420
Very delicious.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.740
I like it very much.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:06.980
Thank you.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.180
Don't make a sound.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.700
So beautiful!

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.340
I didn't mean it.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.420
I didn't mean it.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.740
Actually, you remember

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.500
that night of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.340
I remember too.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.670
♪Enjoy the endless world to the fullest♪

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.720
♪Swallowing everything;
Time will tell♪

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.680
♪Don't let true feelings wait in vain♪

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.980
What are you doing?

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.380
Let me go.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.030
♪Leave the worries to the future♪

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.920
♪Can we not plan♪

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.410
♪Not hope, not look back♪

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.100
So,

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.500
you understand what I want?

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.540
I know.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.860
You want to match Anran with Lady Shen.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.300
Anyone can see

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.500
that they both have feelings
for each other.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.500
Yet not knowing why,

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.980
they refuse to make it clear.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.900
They are like this.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.300
What about you?

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.860
In fact, ever since the Prince Consort
fell seriously ill,

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.900
I have been living each day in a haze.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.740
I have never dared to hope

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.380
that there could be someone
in this world

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.420
to walk hand in hand with me.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.140
We...

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.820
I am flattered,

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.820
but unworthy of your favor.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.220
In those years,

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.260
you and the Prince Consort got married.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.800
It was a matter of state affairs,

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.380
yet not a pleasant matter.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.620
I know this matter has been weighing

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.340
on your mind for years.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.820
But my abilities are limited.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.380
I am by no means the worthy person

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.980
who could bring joy to you once again.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.220
So,

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.500
setting aside the chaos of the world,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.300
have you ever,

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.940
even for a moment,

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.820
had genuine feelings for me?

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.780
Please do not make things difficult
for me.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.140
(Lin Yan)

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.620
It wasn't written by me.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.820
I didn't ask.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.840
What about these injuries?

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.700
It wasn't caused by you yourself?

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:37.940
It wasn't me.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.740
Shen Shaoguang,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.260
are you going to keep enduring

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.020
and restraining yourself

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.100
in this way?

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.980
You obviously have me in your heart.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.460
Why must you do this?

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.340
If you are worried

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.900
that what I'm doing now
will implicate you all,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.060
I promise,

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.900
after the matter is settled,

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.060
I will go ask your family.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.940
I will definitely reassure them

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.990
and make them agree
for you and me to be together,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.300
alright?

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.820
Lin Yan,

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.700
you know what?

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.480
Actually, I simply

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.140
am not someone who is engaged to you.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.460
My family has never lived in Qingyang.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.660
What are you talking about?

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.980
I have been deceiving you all along.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.620
The situation was urgent at the time.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.020
I was afraid you might actually kill us,

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.980
so I made up this lie.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.420
Later,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.000
I continued the lie

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.640
because I wanted
to take advantage of you

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.860
and moved into Yunshui Manor.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.480
I originally thought I could
deceive you for as long as possible.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.020
But this time,

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.980
at the border between Qingyang
and Shi'an,

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.170
I ran into the person
who truly has been engaged to you,

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.380
Lady Zheng.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.860
In the Qingyang accent,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.140
the pronunciation of Shen
and Zheng is similar.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.460
I used this to fool you.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.980
But I am neither blind in heart
nor in eyes.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.100
All along,

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.340
how you have treated me

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.620
cannot be faked.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.980
Shen Shaoguang,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.700
in your heart, you clearly have...

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.540
No.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.980
Never ever.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.140
Mr. Lin,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.780
I impersonated someone else's identity.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.180
I am utterly shameless.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.620
The fiancée your parents hoped

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.780
you would take good care of
before they passed away

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.100
is someone else.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.780
I am sorry.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.380
I am truly sorry to you.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.140
with renovations

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.140

Great!

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.670
That's great.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.140
Welcome all of you to come

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.140

Great.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.300
Now I announce

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.900

Auspicious Chinese New Year, everyone.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.340
Good luck in the Chinese New Year.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.780
Good luck in the Chinese New Year.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.780
Lady Shen,

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.580
your restaurant is really beautiful.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.180
Thank you. Auspicious Chinese New Year.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.240
Auspicious Chinese New Year.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.420
- So comfortable.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.620
May everything go as you wish.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.500
Lady Shen,

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.560
good luck in the Chinese New Year.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.140
Good luck in the Chinese New Year.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.180
This is modeled
after the palace's Spring Platter,

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.780
and is called the Little Spring Platter.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.500
Enjoy your meal.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.260
Lady Shen,

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.660
it's just the beginning of spring.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.820
It hasn't warmed up yet.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.700
Where does your restaurant

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.420
get so many fresh melons and vegetables?

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.100
- Where, Lady Shen?
- Tell us about it.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.770
Temperature control and wind protection.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.020
Only the greenhouse can do it.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.020
Greenhouse?

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.780
What is a greenhouse?

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.300
Why did she leave?

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.260
Manager Liu, Manager Zhao.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.130
Please, please.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.360
- Good fortune
- Good fortune.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.740
Thank you.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.180
- Take your seats.
- Please.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.500
- Take your seats.
- Lady Shen,

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.580
we saw the sign outside

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.900
listing a specialty dish

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.140
called Little Spring Platter.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:36.990
Could you get us one?

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.900
Sure.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.740
Mother,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.370
a portion of Little Spring Platter.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.300
Alright, alright.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.420
Then do it yourselves.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.140
The dishes are coming.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.420
Deyuan, prepare some more vegetables.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.260
Alright.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.420
The fish for you two.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.990
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks a lot.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.460
Mother, mother, look at me.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.420
Lady Shen.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.100
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.500
Your place is really quite unique.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.240
- The kids are willing to play here.
- Yeah.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.020
As long as they like it.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.300
Children,

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.460
want to drink soy milk?

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.730
- Auntie.
- I want to drink.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.140
I want to drink.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.140
Yangyang.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.020
I want to drink.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.340
- Line up.
- Be careful.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.380
Look.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.340
These naughty kids

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.100
only listen to Yangyang.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.010
Yes.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.380
Come here, children.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.660
Be careful, it's hot.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.860
- Auntie.
- Good girl.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.690
After hearing that I study
in Hongwen Academy,

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.860
they all admire me.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.180
Then should you be a good role model

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.780
and lead them?

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.020
The mentor said
you are a promising talent.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.240
If you can take the right path,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.480
you will achieve great things.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.940
Then next spring,

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.020
are you...

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:46.800
I will study hard

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.920
and make progress every day.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.940
Be careful, it's hot.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.180
Your master has been busy

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.840
for several days with the matter

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.220
of relocating the ancestral grave.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.980
It has all been sorted out now, right?

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.310
Yes, the Capital Prefecture

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.380
issued a new decree stating that

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.740
all matters
concerning the common people

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.260
- must be resolved in seven days.
- Be careful. So hot.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.350
- In case of dereliction of duty,
- Thank you.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.700
then the people may go beat the drum

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.910
to report it to the Prefecture.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.080
This matter in my family

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.460
has been delayed for several years.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.180
They all pass the buck to each other.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.220
If it weren't for the decisive actions

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.180
of Mr. Lin,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.900
we wouldn't know how it would end.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.500
No wonder everyone praises him.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.940
A rare and admirable official.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.220
Exactly. With him here,

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.580
it'll be easier later.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:28.220
(Capital Prefecture)

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:33.660
- Wait a minute.
- Here.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.700
Mr. Lin will be out soon.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.100
Add some hot water.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.130
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.060
The Lantern Festival isn't over yet.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.420
Mr. Lin has already dragged me out.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.900
Stop complaining.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.020
I'm telling you,

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.860
although I can't read a single word,

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.900
I remember clearly

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.340
every single word spoken by Mr. Lin.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.100
Matters of the people,
whether big or small,

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.990
all should be reported.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.800
Whatever is reported,

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.620
it must be resolved.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.460
Look.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.140
All the people of Yong'an praise him.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.990
Even His Majesty speak words
of gold and jade,

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.140
praising Mr. Lin as the Zhao Guanghan
of our dynasty.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:03.110
Think about it.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.500
Since even His Majesty has said so,

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.420
from now on,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.900
if anything happens in the Prefecture,

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.100
it will be much easier for us

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.670
to ask various departments for help.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.980
Well, that's true.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.220
But he hasn't been home

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.620
these past few days either,

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.000
getting up earlier than the roosters
every day.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.040
It seems to me like

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.040
when Wang Laosan divorced his wife,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.120
he could only immerse himself
in official duties.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.350
Don't worry.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.100
Even if it's the Wei family
from Guanzhong,

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.860
the Prefecture will never harbor them.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.840
Your farmland

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.880
will surely be recovered.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.380
- Thank you, Mr. Lin.
- My pleasure.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.260
Don't talk nonsense.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.420
Indeed.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.300
I haven't seen Mr. Lin's cousin
for a long time.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.200
I'm telling you,

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.440
these past few days, Mr. Lin...

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.420
Could it be

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.740
that...

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.380
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.460
Criticizing your superiors,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.360
what crime should you be charged?

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.260
We should be...

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.100
Just punish him.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.950
As long as you don't dock my salary,
it's fine.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.540
Mr. Lin, it wasn't me who said that.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.380
Alright.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.820
I'll punish you

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.820
to go rest first

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.700
and build up strength.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.380
You still have to go with me

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.740
to deal with the matter of Mr. Wei
forcibly occupying land.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:09.620
Really?

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.740
Hurry up and go.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.100
(Candied garlic, Laba garlic)

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.500
So beautiful!

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.100
Although I still miss my hometown,

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.460
after going through so much lately,

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.180
I seem to be growing more and more
fond of this place.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.380
There is no curfew
during the Lantern Festival.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.900
It'll be more beautiful
when the city is full of lanterns.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.260
By then,

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.060
I'll take you to see it again.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.820
Time really flies.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.620
It's already the Lantern Festival.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.060
Young Master.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.100
Come in.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.060
Young Master.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.340
I found it out.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.180
How is it?

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.220
Lady Zheng, as Lady Shen said,

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.620
who is truly betrothed to you,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.060
currently resides in Shi'an County.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.140
I went there to inquire.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.990
This Lady Zheng indeed

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.540
has moved from Qingyang.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.180
And in the Qingyang dialect,

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.700
the pronunciation of Zheng and Shen

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.450
is very similar.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.740
That's why the Shen family

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.460
could have deceived us for so long.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.380
Young Master,

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:06.780
well...

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.340
Let it go.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.820
From now on,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.600
we cut off all dealings
with the Shen family.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.320
We will never fall
for their tricks again.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.860
Today is the Lantern Festival.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.060
It's a holiday.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.660
You have been busy all day.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.740
You haven't eaten, right?

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.540
Look what I brought you.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.320
There is no curfew
during the Lantern Festival.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.660
It'll be more beautiful
when the city is full of lanterns.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.340
By then,

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.660
I'll take you to see it again.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.580
Look.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.780
It's still warm.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.780
Have a little bite.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.780
Once the official business is done,

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.380
let's go to Shi'an first.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.020
Jicai,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.980
why are you still awake?

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.060
Did I disturb you?

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.820
No, I just got up to use the bathroom.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.380
Have you not been sleeping well

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.740
these past few days?

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.700
It's fine. I can't sleep anyway.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.620
I'll arrange all the pickles now,

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.100
so we can serve it faster tomorrow.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.140
Alright, don't do it.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.460
- It's fine.
- Go back to sleep.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.100
You go to sleep.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:25.980
Give me the knife.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.400
- It's fine.
- Give it to me.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.180
It's fine.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.490
- Hurry up, Jicai.
- Be careful.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:36.980
Let me have a look.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:57.980
Jicai,

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.500
I can understand you.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.700
As long as you're human,

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.300
you'll feel pain

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.300
and also need to vent.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.060
But there are many ways to vent.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.540
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.380
Do you know?

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.180
I didn't mean it.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.500
I just thought
of the desensitization method.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.460
When I couldn't let go,

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.060
I would just tighten the rope.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.340
People are afraid of pain.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.340
If it hurts, I won't think anymore.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.500
I'm in pain.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.540
I have no backbone.
I still keep thinking about it.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.140
My silly girl.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.220
My silly girl.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.140
Who said you have no backbone?

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.100
You like someone so sincerely.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.460
So courageous!

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.380
It's a pity.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.660
You have no way.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.740
But you know what,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.580
Jicai?

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.740
You are bravely cutting your losses.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.620
You've already done really well.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.380
I'm useless.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.940
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.780
Don't cry anymore.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.580
Don't hurt yourself again next time.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.660
Do you know?

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:15.980
Here.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.700
Don't cry, it's OK.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.220
I'm here.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.140
Your crying sounds like water boiling.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.420
