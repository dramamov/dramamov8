Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:20.586
But I still have doubts about that employee.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.351
Do you think he's the one who assaulted you?

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:23.564
Ahhh!

00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:24.543
Ouch!

00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:26.619
They were aiming to kill.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.033
It could be the noodle shop uncle's son.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.095
You know Tum likes Kratae, right?

00:00:31.293 --> 00:00:32.514
I don't like women.

00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:34.540
I like men.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.313
It's surprising that Uncle Peng and Dr. Wut are boyfriends.

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:37.950
Hey!

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:42.504
I think I know now whether you like women or men.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.741
So you're aware now, huh?

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.114
So you're aware now, huh?

00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:40.392
Hey.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.153
Don't forget to help me
move the donated stuff.

00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:47.803
The old work is not even done

00:01:47.803 --> 00:01:49.018
and now there is new work again.

00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:50.764
I haven't even got my salary yet.

00:01:50.764 --> 00:01:51.959
I'll buy a new phone.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.110
You don't need to buy one.

00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:55.097
Just use my old one.

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.414
Money is all you ever think about, huh?

00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:01.158
Well, life runs on money, doesn't it?

00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:03.730
Before you start thinking about money,
do the work I assigned first.

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.531
You didn't do what I told you to,
but you went fixing that noodle shop instead.

00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:09.308
You even took my stuff without asking.

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.553
I hate that thief habit of yours.

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:13.277
I just wanted to help that uncle.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.073
But that's not the right way.

00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:17.166
Good intentions have to come
with good methods too.

00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:19.639
And don't keep secrets from me
while you're here.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:20.937
Yes, sir!

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.665
Yeah, right.

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:31.983
Look at him
telling others not to have secrets.

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:33.754
He himself hides plenty.

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:39.624
Will you tell Uncle Peng
that you've already found out about Dr. Wut?

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:41.384
Not yet.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.219
Let me dig a little more.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.759
Once I know enough, I'll use it against him.

00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:50.131
You're not thinking
of blackmailing him, are you?

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:51.846
I'm not joining in.

00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:53.736
He's been really kind to me.

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:54.965
Whatever. You don't have to know.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:56.961
I want to know,
so I'll investigate.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.878
You're a super nice guy, huh?

00:02:59.032 --> 00:03:00.461
I'm the jerk here.

00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:09.776
Hey.

00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:13.900
About last night…

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.882
Why did you do that to me?

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:21.597
Do you know

00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:24.628
I couldn't sleep all night?

00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:31.047
It just felt weird.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.194
I don't even know how to explain it.

00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:40.119
I just want to know

00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:43.940
how you feel.

00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:46.827
Ooh~ Woohoo~

00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:49.292
Choo-koo-rooo~

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.787
Ooh~ Woohoo~

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:56.142
Choo-koo-rooo~

00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:17.640
MUSIC & RECREATION ROOM

00:05:37.415 --> 00:05:38.666
If you flatten your fingers like that,

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:40.426
it'll be hard to play.

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:43.200
Keep them relaxed like this.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.238
Don't tense up.

00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:49.667
Also, imagine you're holding a ball.

00:05:49.996 --> 00:05:51.031
Relaxed?

00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:52.424
Like holding a small ball?

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:54.810
Like this, bro?

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.822
Mm-hmm.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:02.870
Mm-hmm.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.191
And practice often.

00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:06.476
Your hands will get used to it.

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:09.262
Wow, you're so good.

00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:14.600
How did you start playing piano?

00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:17.079
I had a teacher,

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:18.647
but they went back to their home country.

00:06:18.647 --> 00:06:22.884
They left the piano at the school
before going back.

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.049
Can I try?

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.466
Sure.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.150
If you're this good, can you teach me?

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:06.583
I can't.

00:07:06.978 --> 00:07:08.094
I'm not a teacher.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.520
But you played so well just now.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.224
I want to be as good as you.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:14.724
Please teach me.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.305
If I get better at piano,

00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:18.940
I might get a spot at the provincial school.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:21.899
Please.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.028
Please, bro.

00:07:25.807 --> 00:07:29.674
Well, let me think about it first.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.280
Think fast, before I change my mind.

00:08:21.147 --> 00:08:22.164
Lava!

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.624
What are you doing?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.422
I didn't know you had music talent.

00:08:32.135 --> 00:08:33.394
I didn't either.

00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:38.913
But somehow,
my memories feel connected to the piano.

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:47.325
Your memories are all linked
to high-class stuff, huh?

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.775
Hey, kid.

00:08:50.378 --> 00:08:51.666
Yes, bro?

00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:52.753
You know rock music?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.774
Of course.

00:08:53.774 --> 00:08:54.964
Let me show you something.

00:08:54.964 --> 00:08:55.687
Alright.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.296
Get the vibe?

00:08:59.296 --> 00:09:00.280
I get it!

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.664
Can you even teach, though?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.225
You don't even remember your own name.

00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:15.272
But I remember every note.

00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:18.229
I guess Dr. Wut was right.

00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:22.346
Your memory might come back
when you reconnect with familiar things.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.153
I'll tell the principal.

00:09:26.373 --> 00:09:27.492
That boy will be happy.

00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:29.575
Thanks, Uncle Peng!

00:09:32.386 --> 00:09:32.988
Ahh!

00:09:34.569 --> 00:09:36.807
Dr. Wut is always right.

00:09:39.354 --> 00:09:41.211
He's a doctor, so of course he's right.

00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:44.702
He studied this
and has seen lots of similar cases.

00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:47.781
What he says has credibility.

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:49.469
What's your problem?

00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:50.927
Nothing.

00:09:50.927 --> 00:09:53.149
You just seem to know Dr. Wut really well.

00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:58.144
Shut it!

00:10:16.775 --> 00:10:18.520
I'm going to the district office.

00:10:19.113 --> 00:10:20.688
You two clean the boat.

00:10:21.896 --> 00:10:22.664
Got it.

00:10:22.928 --> 00:10:24.742
Don't worry, be happy.

00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:34.727
Bye!

00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:41.207
Where are you going?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.395
I'm following Uncle Peng.

00:10:43.395 --> 00:10:46.351
Why? Stay out of his business.

00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:47.475
They're in love.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.975
It's none of your concern.

00:10:49.612 --> 00:10:52.157
I happen to care about my uncle.

00:10:52.157 --> 00:10:53.868
He's my family member.

00:10:53.868 --> 00:10:55.101
You just want to be nosy.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.911
Of course. So what?

00:10:57.087 --> 00:10:58.539
If you don't, that's your problem.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:10:59.391
Move.

00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:12.344
Ha! Acting all righteous,
but you're just as nosy as me.

00:11:12.344 --> 00:11:13.186
Another nosy neighbor!

00:11:19.818 --> 00:11:23.224
Hey, I've been working so hard lately.

00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:25.308
I barely got any rest.

00:11:27.943 --> 00:11:30.876
I'm talking with the community council
about getting more doctors here.

00:11:31.227 --> 00:11:33.075
The hospital doctors can't handle it.

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:37.511
Patients from the whole island and tourists
are more than the staff can manage.

00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:42.871
My boyfriend is going to have sunken eyes.

00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:43.723
He won't look good anymore.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.271
Hey, my friend's coming from Bangkok.

00:11:59.237 --> 00:12:02.310
He's my old archaeology classmate.

00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:05.235
He's here to scout for
underwater archaeology sites.

00:12:06.135 --> 00:12:07.811
I want to meet your friend too.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:10.945
Since we started dating,

00:12:11.274 --> 00:12:13.102
I've never met anyone in your life,

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.947
except Lava.

00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:16.506
It's not necessary.

00:12:17.143 --> 00:12:18.588
I'm on my own.

00:12:19.576 --> 00:12:21.058
You don't need to know anyone else.

00:12:22.222 --> 00:12:23.670
Just having me is enough.

00:12:54.885 --> 00:12:57.296
So they sneaked out here
for a romantic picnic, huh?

00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:59.156
From the looks of it,

00:12:59.617 --> 00:13:00.741
I'd say they've ve been dating
for a while now.

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:02.341
How could you know?

00:13:04.822 --> 00:13:06.058
Body language, you know.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.919
All that shoulder-to-shoulder sitting,

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:09.550
staring into each other's eyes
like fighting fish.

00:13:09.857 --> 00:13:12.323
They've been together at least 2 years.

00:13:12.323 --> 00:13:13.302
No doubt.

00:13:16.969 --> 00:13:20.965
But how can lovers hide

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.983
and still be happy?

00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:29.719
Sometimes, their responsibilities in life
make it not so easy to love each other.

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:32.094
You sure know a lot.

00:13:32.577 --> 00:13:33.721
Have you ever dated anyone, huh?

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.502
Who knows?

00:13:37.556 --> 00:13:39.393
Maybe someone who loves me
is waiting for me.

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.833
Let's go back.

00:13:50.037 --> 00:13:50.855
Hold on.

00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:52.411
The best part is coming up.

00:14:11.582 --> 00:14:12.380
Let's go back.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.681
Not now!

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.167
Don't move.

00:14:22.024 --> 00:14:23.413
What's wrong with you?

00:14:24.423 --> 00:14:27.365
There's a spider on your left shoulder.

00:14:40.365 --> 00:14:41.160
Don't move.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.201
It's crawling inside your shirt.

00:14:42.201 --> 00:14:44.219
It's crawling inside your shirt!

00:14:44.219 --> 00:14:45.903
Hey?! Ahhh!

00:14:45.903 --> 00:14:47.118
Ahhh!

00:14:47.118 --> 00:14:47.875
Where is it?!

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:49.237
- Where is it?!
- Stay still!

00:14:49.237 --> 00:14:50.129
I told you to stay still!

00:14:50.129 --> 00:14:50.984
Stay still!

00:14:51.248 --> 00:14:52.370
Ugh!!!

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.804
Ahhh!

00:14:53.804 --> 00:14:54.763
Wave, watch out!

00:14:54.763 --> 00:14:55.391
Hey!

00:14:57.018 --> 00:14:58.528
Lava! Wave!

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:03.154
You guys followed me?

00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:05.220
No.

00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:07.439
We came to swim.

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.748
Wave was about to jump in.

00:15:10.027 --> 00:15:10.857
Am I right, Wave?

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:14.268
Right?

00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:17.340
Yeah.

00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:21.593
It's so hot.

00:15:21.593 --> 00:15:23.958
Wave, don't act slick like him.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.779
Tell me!

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.584
You followed me here, didn't you?

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.913
Why did you have to hide the fact

00:15:35.354 --> 00:15:36.656
that you're dating Dr. Wut from me?

00:15:40.395 --> 00:15:41.568
Are you my dad?

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.021
Why should I report to you?

00:15:43.021 --> 00:15:44.087
Calm down.

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:45.103
I think Lava didn't do this on purpose.

00:15:45.103 --> 00:15:46.143
He did!

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.918
Why do you even care about my life?

00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:50.119
I don't.

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.312
It's just I live with you.

00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:54.402
I don't want you to feel awkward.

00:15:55.145 --> 00:15:57.589
You can just do anything at home.

00:15:57.868 --> 00:16:00.833
No need to sneak around
or make out outside

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:03.784
unless you're into outdoor stuff.

00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:05.574
Talking like this,

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:07.410
you're being rude to Dr. Wut!

00:16:08.316 --> 00:16:10.526
It's okay. I don't mind.

00:16:10.526 --> 00:16:11.424
But I do!

00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:17.074
I can do whatever I want, wherever I want

00:16:17.538 --> 00:16:19.339
because I'm responsible for my own life

00:16:19.966 --> 00:16:24.972
Did you ask him
if he's okay living like this?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.995
You want to keep him a secret forever?

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.709
Dating the chief, he'd want to show it off.

00:16:33.336 --> 00:16:34.537
Don't try to think for him.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.125
Let's go home, doc.

00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:39.693
I'll drop you off.

00:16:46.986 --> 00:16:49.063
You two, see me at home.

00:16:56.169 --> 00:16:58.355
You were too harsh on Uncle Peng.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.478
He probably has a reason for not telling you.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.006
How hard would it be to just tell me?

00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:05.345
I'd absolutely understand.

00:17:06.924 --> 00:17:09.632
But Uncle Peng doesn't know
you're like him too.

00:17:11.141 --> 00:17:12.873
It's not something you can just say out loud.

00:17:13.152 --> 00:17:14.631
It's normal, isn't it?

00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:16.270
Hiding makes it abnormal.

00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:21.488
Why are you brave enough
to say you like men?

00:17:22.045 --> 00:17:23.780
That's because it's not a big deal.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.719
Do your parents know?

00:17:28.555 --> 00:17:31.037
Maybe. Maybe not.

00:17:31.803 --> 00:17:34.133
It doesn't matter.

00:17:34.412 --> 00:17:37.347
I don't need anyone
to approve of my sexuality.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.379
But for some people,

00:17:40.168 --> 00:17:41.338
it's a big deal.

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:44.810
You should care about
the people who love you too.

00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:49.584
Does anyone love me?

00:18:12.939 --> 00:18:13.521
Mm-hmm.

00:18:29.197 --> 00:18:30.316
Thanks.

00:18:32.452 --> 00:18:34.913
I remember you like this one.

00:18:41.369 --> 00:18:42.686
You really pay attention to me, huh?

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.239
Isn't it good?

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.493
It's good.

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:52.061
Do you want some?

00:18:53.361 --> 00:18:53.955
Shrimp?

00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:55.300
I'm good.

00:18:55.811 --> 00:18:57.613
Or squid?

00:18:58.426 --> 00:18:59.423
I'm good.

00:18:59.887 --> 00:19:00.443
Soup?

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:01.102
No.

00:19:01.102 --> 00:19:02.049
Basil?

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:02.760
No.

00:19:02.946 --> 00:19:03.805
Then don't eat.

00:19:04.223 --> 00:19:05.008
I'll eat it myself.

00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:08.551
Lava.

00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:10.510
Yeah?

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.831
Changed your mind, huh?

00:19:11.831 --> 00:19:13.458
You want it now?

00:19:16.616 --> 00:19:18.243
I want to ask you something.

00:19:22.191 --> 00:19:23.013
About what?

00:19:27.657 --> 00:19:28.914
About me kissing you, right?

00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:32.602
Yes.

00:19:34.228 --> 00:19:35.271
Why did you kiss me?

00:19:36.362 --> 00:19:39.522
I saw you've been uneasy
and holding it in for so long.

00:19:40.195 --> 00:19:42.886
I just helped make your dream come true.

00:19:44.442 --> 00:19:47.436
And you didn't feel anything?

00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:50.128
Feel what?

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.504
It's just like a one-night thing.

00:19:54.504 --> 00:19:56.145
It's like kissing someone at a bar or club.

00:20:02.856 --> 00:20:04.227
Do you want some?
I can feed you.

00:20:05.202 --> 00:20:07.854
Ahhh!

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.622
Why did I get only 8,000?

00:20:18.062 --> 00:20:21.319
New grads start at least 15,000.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.472
You're not that good at your job.

00:20:25.006 --> 00:20:26.071
That's enough for you.

00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:32.343
You're mad at me for secretly
snooping on you and Dr. Wut, right?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.996
I cut your pay because

00:20:34.996 --> 00:20:37.393
you spent the time you were supposed
to be watching the resort on nonsense.

00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:39.160
I'm sorry then.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.545
I just wanted you to know
we're on the same team.

00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:43.890
You can live freely.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.934
There's no need to hide anymore.

00:20:48.628 --> 00:20:50.729
You don't have to expect everyone
to be as bold as you.

00:20:51.449 --> 00:20:53.313
Everyone has their own life.

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:54.944
Stop pressuring me.

00:20:56.198 --> 00:20:57.942
When we're done here,
pick Wave up from school.

00:20:57.942 --> 00:20:59.395
I'm taking my friend out.

00:21:01.578 --> 00:21:02.148
Peng!

00:21:08.743 --> 00:21:09.880
Long time no see.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.536
You look even better and fitter now.

00:21:12.186 --> 00:21:14.964
Don't flatter me. I'm the same.

00:21:15.336 --> 00:21:16.271
Same?

00:21:16.271 --> 00:21:17.738
You're the chief of this island,

00:21:18.063 --> 00:21:21.003
leaving me to do my government job
as an archaeologist all alone.

00:21:21.793 --> 00:21:22.792
You left me, dude.

00:21:26.391 --> 00:21:28.070
This is my nephew, Lava.
He's just here from Bangkok.

00:21:28.534 --> 00:21:31.404
Lava, this is Korn, my college friend.

00:21:33.076 --> 00:21:33.892
Hello.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.669
We'll drop your luggage at the resort first.

00:21:35.832 --> 00:21:37.095
Then, I'll show you around.

00:21:37.815 --> 00:21:40.021
Lava, lift his luggage.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.737
It's fine. I can do it myself.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.378
No need.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.510
That's his job.

00:21:53.546 --> 00:21:54.413
Get in, Korn.

00:21:55.017 --> 00:21:55.934
Thank you for taking care of it.

00:22:11.307 --> 00:22:12.882
Your car is pretty cool, by the way.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.905
Ahhh!

00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:31.193
Ouch!

00:22:54.589 --> 00:22:55.289
Wow,

00:22:55.777 --> 00:22:57.705
you're learning so fast, Aomsin.

00:22:58.262 --> 00:22:59.766
You're such a great and kind teacher.

00:22:59.766 --> 00:23:00.898
That's why I could learn fast.

00:23:01.827 --> 00:23:03.351
But I only got through one part.

00:23:03.746 --> 00:23:05.321
Classical music is tough, isn't it?

00:23:06.436 --> 00:23:08.456
Everything is tough.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.784
The key is to really focus on practicing.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.440
Okay. But I can't come often.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.124
I have to help my dad fish.

00:23:16.681 --> 00:23:19.285
It would be nice
to have a piano at home to practice,

00:23:19.424 --> 00:23:22.105
but that's probably impossible
since they're so expensive.

00:23:22.662 --> 00:23:24.018
Then just practice here.

00:23:24.157 --> 00:23:26.622
I'll teach you until you're great.

00:23:26.622 --> 00:23:27.492
Sure.

00:23:27.724 --> 00:23:28.854
I'll go now.

00:23:28.854 --> 00:23:30.018
My dad's waiting.

00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:31.401
Bye, teacher.

00:23:31.401 --> 00:23:31.901
Bye.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.879
Hello, Uncle.

00:23:44.879 --> 00:23:46.109
Hi.

00:23:59.819 --> 00:24:00.554
Wave!

00:24:02.737 --> 00:24:03.374
Eh?

00:24:04.535 --> 00:24:05.494
I've been looking for you.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:08.753
Why are you here?

00:24:09.334 --> 00:24:10.108
Where is Uncle Peng?

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.211
He told me to pick you up.

00:24:12.652 --> 00:24:13.852
He asked you to do this?

00:24:14.525 --> 00:24:15.299
It's fine.

00:24:15.717 --> 00:24:16.721
I'll go home myself.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.740
Why are you mad at me?

00:24:21.692 --> 00:24:22.931
I'm not mad.

00:24:23.651 --> 00:24:26.228
I just know I'm not special.

00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:27.932
What are you talking about?

00:24:28.164 --> 00:24:28.851
See?

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.519
You don't pay attention at all.

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:33.365
You don't have to remember
anything you said.

00:24:35.223 --> 00:24:35.826
Move.

00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:37.140
I'm going home.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.781
You're walking?

00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:41.392
It's far.

00:24:41.926 --> 00:24:44.726
Good. I'll exercise a bit.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.201
Since I came here,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.013
I haven't taken care of myself lately.

00:24:50.013 --> 00:24:51.901
I've been taking in bad stuff.

00:24:52.946 --> 00:24:55.671
The closer I get,
the more toxic it feels.

00:25:01.778 --> 00:25:02.394
Wave.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.428
Huh?

00:25:05.521 --> 00:25:07.085
Don't tell me the janitor locked the door?

00:25:08.409 --> 00:25:10.071
Uncle! Uncle!

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:10.840
That's him!

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.340
Uncle!

00:25:11.526 --> 00:25:12.940
We're inside! Uncle!

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.130
We're trapped in here!

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:14.882
Uncle!

00:25:15.532 --> 00:25:16.466
Hey!

00:25:16.745 --> 00:25:17.457
Uncle!

00:25:20.429 --> 00:25:21.491
Should we try that way?

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.186
Are you crazy?

00:25:23.743 --> 00:25:25.841
That is solid metal.
How could we get out?

00:25:33.644 --> 00:25:34.530
Tum.

00:25:35.482 --> 00:25:36.949
I'll call Tum.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.987
Mom, you look like a sick cat.

00:25:44.987 --> 00:25:45.680
What should I do then?

00:25:47.352 --> 00:25:48.614
Wait. My friend is calling.

00:25:50.054 --> 00:25:50.691
Hello?

00:25:51.086 --> 00:25:51.701
(Tum.)

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.185
Come help us.

00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:54.821
The janitor locked us in the library.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.698
I'm stuck here with Wave.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.469
What the hell are you doing there?

00:25:59.653 --> 00:26:01.724
You think I want to be here?

00:26:01.933 --> 00:26:02.630
Just hurry!

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.587
Don't ask too much.

00:26:04.028 --> 00:26:05.130
Fine, fine.

00:26:05.827 --> 00:26:06.674
Come help us.

00:26:06.674 --> 00:26:07.469
Come now, okay?

00:26:16.642 --> 00:26:19.035
Um... what are you two doing?

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.099
Tum's making me film a video.

00:26:23.842 --> 00:26:25.442
Come on, we should keep up with trends.

00:26:25.442 --> 00:26:26.948
Don't you want to be young again?

00:26:27.087 --> 00:26:29.140
Besides, this one can't be done alone.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.576
You're such a complainer.

00:26:30.808 --> 00:26:32.431
I even brought you to the doctor.

00:26:33.174 --> 00:26:36.947
All you did was take me to the doctor
and now I owe you my life, huh?

00:26:36.947 --> 00:26:38.279
Ouch!

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:38.896
Ouch!

00:26:38.896 --> 00:26:39.722
Please don't argue here.

00:26:40.117 --> 00:26:41.657
You can see the doctor now.

00:26:41.657 --> 00:26:42.420
It's your turn.

00:26:42.884 --> 00:26:43.709
See?

00:26:43.709 --> 00:26:44.825
The doctor just called.

00:26:44.825 --> 00:26:46.399
I almost missed my appointment.

00:26:46.399 --> 00:26:47.065
Tum!

00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:49.352
You brat!

00:26:50.513 --> 00:26:53.670
Tum, you can't film your content here.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.130
This is a hospital.

00:26:55.409 --> 00:26:56.702
You're complaining again.

00:26:57.097 --> 00:26:58.674
Come on, I'm just killing time.

00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:03.148
Also, waiting for a doctor
at a public hospital takes forever.

00:27:06.956 --> 00:27:07.975
Ugh, Mom's gone already.

00:27:07.975 --> 00:27:09.081
Who'll film with me now?

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.489
Kratae.

00:27:17.489 --> 00:27:18.168
Huh?

00:27:18.795 --> 00:27:19.815
Come film with me.

00:27:20.024 --> 00:27:20.956
No way.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.216
Please, just a bit.

00:27:22.216 --> 00:27:24.044
No way. I don't know how to do that.

00:27:24.183 --> 00:27:24.915
I'll teach you.

00:27:24.915 --> 00:27:25.441
Come on.

00:27:25.441 --> 00:27:26.245
No.

00:27:26.245 --> 00:27:27.025
Come on. Just for a bit.

00:27:27.025 --> 00:27:27.541
No.

00:27:27.843 --> 00:27:29.651
Then who am I supposed to film with?

00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:32.088
Come on, just a sec.

00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:32.890
Fine.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:33.390
Just a moment.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.468
- Hurry up.
- Yeah.

00:27:35.025 --> 00:27:35.841
Okay.

00:27:36.677 --> 00:27:39.367
When I move the camera here, do this.

00:27:43.338 --> 00:27:44.735
A bit more.

00:27:49.487 --> 00:27:50.382
Yeah, that's it.

00:27:50.382 --> 00:27:51.192
Try it.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.074
Ready?

00:27:57.628 --> 00:27:58.840
Huh, nice.

00:28:00.814 --> 00:28:02.537
You're such an adorable cat.

00:28:04.348 --> 00:28:07.870
Hey, you really want to be
a social media star, huh?

00:28:08.056 --> 00:28:09.909
What do you even have
to compete with others?

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.785
This,

00:28:19.971 --> 00:28:22.138
this, and—

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.688
Don't! This is a hospital.

00:28:26.501 --> 00:28:27.452
Okay.

00:28:27.777 --> 00:28:31.410
If you're going to hit on me
while being so unstable,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.726
I'm out.

00:28:34.398 --> 00:28:36.187
So that means

00:28:39.043 --> 00:28:40.659
if I have money,
I can hit on you?

00:28:42.494 --> 00:28:43.930
It's not about money.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.883
It's about life goals.

00:28:48.832 --> 00:28:49.905
I'm leaving.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.811
My goal is you!

00:28:57.891 --> 00:28:58.714
Shhh.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.382
One day I'll be a social media star
and take care of you!

00:29:16.119 --> 00:29:16.968
Shit! Lava!

00:29:22.007 --> 00:29:25.178
Skills for refusing sex among teenagers.

00:29:25.433 --> 00:29:29.077
When your partner touches your body
or tries to have sex with you,

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.813
you should clearly say,

00:29:31.045 --> 00:29:33.012
“Don't. I don't like this.”

00:29:33.221 --> 00:29:34.342
“Don't do this.”

00:29:34.574 --> 00:29:35.708
“Stop right now.”

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.485
Unless…

00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:42.119
Many animals have the behavior
where the male mates with the female and then leaves,

00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:45.439
not taking care of their offspring
or partner after mating,

00:29:45.578 --> 00:29:47.836
such as certain marine fish,

00:29:48.091 --> 00:29:50.890
ostriches, lizards,

00:29:51.145 --> 00:29:54.391
or cockroaches.

00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:57.404
These animals don't have feelings.

00:29:57.961 --> 00:29:59.509
Their only role is to reproduce.

00:30:03.387 --> 00:30:04.668
You're mad at me
for leaving things hanging, aren't you?

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.998
That doesn't bother me.

00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:11.593
I know people like you always
treat others' feelings like a game.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.760
I just wanted to test you.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.563
Test what?

00:30:14.818 --> 00:30:16.496
If you like men,

00:30:19.074 --> 00:30:20.296
and if you like me.

00:30:23.663 --> 00:30:26.579
You can be sure I like men.

00:30:28.344 --> 00:30:29.504
But about liking you—

00:30:39.725 --> 00:30:42.497
I've got proof
that'll make you realize who you are.

00:30:44.332 --> 00:30:45.084
What proof?

00:30:46.292 --> 00:30:48.227
I'll tell you once you stop being mad at me.

00:30:49.992 --> 00:30:51.814
Then don't ever do that again.

00:30:53.556 --> 00:30:54.435
Why not?

00:30:55.132 --> 00:30:56.458
You liked it, didn't you?

00:31:16.263 --> 00:31:17.033
Lava!

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.175
I'm sorry, man.

00:31:22.175 --> 00:31:23.120
I totally forgot you were here.

00:31:25.071 --> 00:31:26.742
Hey, where are you going?

00:31:28.205 --> 00:31:29.624
Hey, man. It's nothing

00:31:30.065 --> 00:31:31.102
Do you want to read some books?

00:31:31.311 --> 00:31:33.441
Are you crazy? Asking me to read?

00:31:33.441 --> 00:31:34.004
Come on, just read.

00:31:34.468 --> 00:31:35.034
Let's go.

00:31:40.191 --> 00:31:41.316
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:44.592
Yeah, I do.

00:31:44.642 --> 00:31:45.326
Really?

00:31:45.326 --> 00:31:45.883
Uh-huh.

00:31:46.038 --> 00:31:46.788
Who?

00:31:48.836 --> 00:31:49.839
Someone from the island.

00:31:50.805 --> 00:31:52.222
And you're dating openly?

00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:56.881
Don't tell me you're still embarrassed.

00:31:58.833 --> 00:31:59.831
I'm not embarrassed.

00:32:00.991 --> 00:32:02.654
I'm just waiting for the right time.

00:32:04.316 --> 00:32:07.434
With me, you made me wait
until I couldn't take it anymore.

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:08.879
That's why I broke up with you.

00:32:14.889 --> 00:32:18.657
You should have freedom
in every aspect of your life, not just work.

00:32:19.275 --> 00:32:22.395
The person you love wants to be able
to hold your hand anywhere.

00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:24.464
Stop caring about what others think.

00:32:25.604 --> 00:32:26.214
Okay?

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:27.912
Yeah.

00:32:48.826 --> 00:32:52.193
Oh, hello, Mr. Peng.

00:32:53.797 --> 00:32:55.205
Buying coffee, Dr. Wut?

00:32:55.997 --> 00:32:57.293
I've got a night shift today,

00:32:57.562 --> 00:32:58.578
so I need a caffeine boost.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:05.045
Oh, this is Korn, my friend from university.

00:33:06.514 --> 00:33:08.187
This is Dr. Wut.

00:33:08.612 --> 00:33:09.467
He's…

00:33:18.102 --> 00:33:19.483
a doctor at the hospital.

00:33:23.116 --> 00:33:23.875
Hello.

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:25.322
Hello.

00:33:26.018 --> 00:33:27.343
Are you from here?

00:33:28.754 --> 00:33:30.814
Yes, I was born and raised here.

00:33:31.452 --> 00:33:33.167
But I went to med school in Bangkok,

00:33:33.418 --> 00:33:35.083
and now I'm back working at home.

00:33:36.494 --> 00:33:37.693
This place is really beautiful.

00:33:37.693 --> 00:33:38.458
I like it.

00:33:40.468 --> 00:33:42.322
Have you gone sightseeing yet?

00:33:43.733 --> 00:33:45.715
Peng took me to quite a few places—

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.379
diving, rock climbing,

00:33:48.746 --> 00:33:50.784
and we watched the sunset there.

00:33:51.002 --> 00:33:52.021
It was stunning.

00:33:53.644 --> 00:33:55.141
That sounds so fun.

00:33:56.668 --> 00:33:57.957
Even though I'm from here,

00:33:58.189 --> 00:33:59.422
I've never really done all that.

00:34:04.022 --> 00:34:05.601
I'd love to move here.

00:34:06.374 --> 00:34:09.120
I guess I'll need a local to show me around.

00:34:11.226 --> 00:34:12.479
You'll probably need Mr. Peng for that.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.269
He knows this place well.

00:34:16.878 --> 00:34:18.294
I'll go order my coffee now.

00:34:19.222 --> 00:34:20.724
Nice to meet you.

00:34:21.574 --> 00:34:22.287
Nice to meet you too.

00:34:27.157 --> 00:34:30.068
Dude, the doctor here is cute.

00:34:51.002 --> 00:34:53.750
Hey, you don't have to stand this close.

00:34:55.257 --> 00:34:56.349
Feeling stirred up?

00:34:57.354 --> 00:34:59.017
Or are you just afraid
you can't hold yourself back?

00:35:45.002 --> 00:35:46.818
Help look for anything
that might be yours.

00:35:46.818 --> 00:35:50.336
Clothes, bags, cards,
or anything you recognize.

00:35:55.361 --> 00:35:56.154
Looks familiar?

00:35:56.772 --> 00:35:57.466
How about this one?

00:35:57.582 --> 00:35:58.116
No.

00:36:02.831 --> 00:36:03.331
Hey.

00:36:06.013 --> 00:36:07.267
I really recognize this bag.

00:36:14.591 --> 00:36:17.810
Wait, these clothes
look like the ones you were wearing
when I found you.

00:36:27.762 --> 00:36:29.477
I already took the guest's bag to my room.

00:36:30.308 --> 00:36:31.076
Let's split the stuff later.

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.955
It's expensive. We could sell it for a lot.

00:36:40.661 --> 00:36:41.722
What the hell is this?

00:37:12.627 --> 00:37:13.127
Hey!

00:37:13.127 --> 00:37:14.271
What the hell are you guys
doing in my room?

00:37:16.977 --> 00:37:18.246
How did you even get in?

00:37:18.962 --> 00:37:20.248
You stole my friend's bag!

00:37:20.248 --> 00:37:21.560
Stole what? Don't make things up!

00:37:21.792 --> 00:37:23.645
You broke into the hotel.

00:37:23.645 --> 00:37:24.652
You're the one in trouble!

00:37:28.652 --> 00:37:30.084
Wave, run!

00:37:31.031 --> 00:37:32.631
Come here! Where are you going?!

00:38:25.572 --> 00:38:26.412
Please let me go.

00:38:26.799 --> 00:38:28.017
I didn't know anything.

00:38:28.017 --> 00:38:29.003
Didn't know?

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:30.396
You almost killed me just now!

00:38:30.396 --> 00:38:32.585
Hey, calm down.

00:38:36.044 --> 00:38:37.135
Tell me the truth,

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:39.100
or I'll hand you to the police.

00:38:40.414 --> 00:38:42.705
No, please! I can't go to jail.

00:38:43.014 --> 00:38:44.983
I've got a kid and a mother to take care of.

00:38:45.215 --> 00:38:46.258
Then tell me.

00:38:46.258 --> 00:38:48.223
Were you the one who attacked my friend
and threw him into the sea?

00:38:48.416 --> 00:38:49.844
No, it wasn't me.

00:38:50.042 --> 00:38:51.514
Then how did you get that bag?

00:38:57.159 --> 00:38:58.574
I stole it from your room.

00:39:02.202 --> 00:39:04.937
It was that night
when you went to watch the fireworks.

00:39:05.014 --> 00:39:07.972
You looked like you had money,

00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:10.165
so I broke in and took your stuff.

00:39:11.653 --> 00:39:14.367
What about my cards and documents?

00:39:16.261 --> 00:39:17.365
I burned them all.

00:39:17.462 --> 00:39:18.100
What?

00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:22.555
I was scared they'd trace them back to me.

00:39:22.555 --> 00:39:24.689
So you were going to run us over
to shut us up?

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:27.496
I didn't mean to kill you.
I just wanted to scare you.

00:39:27.496 --> 00:39:29.031
Scare me? Scare me?!

00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:29.825
Please.

00:39:35.487 --> 00:39:36.204
It's my business.

00:39:36.687 --> 00:39:37.607
Let me handle this.

00:39:53.981 --> 00:39:57.122
You know I can't remember anything.

00:39:58.762 --> 00:40:03.073
It's terrible not knowing who I am
or where I'm from.

00:40:08.252 --> 00:40:09.397
Can't you help me somehow?

00:40:11.987 --> 00:40:13.397
I can't help you.

00:40:13.861 --> 00:40:17.042
I burned all your documents.

00:40:17.042 --> 00:40:17.933
You liar.

00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:19.772
You're going to jail.

00:40:19.772 --> 00:40:22.436
Please don't! I can't go to jail.

00:40:22.919 --> 00:40:25.554
My mom's paralyzed, and my kid's still little.

00:40:25.554 --> 00:40:26.485
I need to take care of them.

00:40:26.794 --> 00:40:29.223
I only did it for the money.

00:40:29.223 --> 00:40:30.591
Please, give me another chance.

00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:32.633
I promise I'll change.

00:40:41.343 --> 00:40:41.988
Fine.

00:40:45.002 --> 00:40:46.264
I'll give you a chance.

00:40:47.655 --> 00:40:49.104
But you have to promise

00:40:50.341 --> 00:40:51.669
you'll never do anything wrong again.

00:40:55.341 --> 00:40:58.928
Poverty isn't an excuse for doing wrong.

00:41:01.092 --> 00:41:02.697
Yes. I promise!

00:41:03.354 --> 00:41:04.095
Thank you.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:06.242
I promise I won't do it again.

00:41:07.788 --> 00:41:10.331
Seriously? That's it?

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:19.752
It hurts.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.178
You shouldn't have trusted him.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.745
He could be lying.

00:41:29.793 --> 00:41:31.223
Didn't you see his tears?

00:41:31.687 --> 00:41:32.918
I think he was telling the truth.

00:41:34.077 --> 00:41:35.815
Even if I turned him in,

00:41:36.897 --> 00:41:38.588
it wouldn't help me
remember anything anyway.

00:41:40.076 --> 00:41:42.065
You're too kind.

00:41:43.051 --> 00:41:46.028
Forgiveness is the best gift

00:41:46.608 --> 00:41:47.995
we can give each other.

00:42:07.582 --> 00:42:10.332
Thanks a lot for saving my life.

00:42:11.433 --> 00:42:13.996
If it weren't for you,
I'd probably be with my dad by now.

00:42:20.867 --> 00:42:23.082
If I hadn't been hot-headed
and sharp-tongued,

00:42:23.585 --> 00:42:25.157
my dad would still be here with me.

00:42:27.263 --> 00:42:28.873
It's not your fault.

00:42:29.762 --> 00:42:30.693
Don't blame yourself.

00:42:32.529 --> 00:42:34.354
Every time I try to help someone,

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.572
I always end up getting screwed.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.530
At least you helped me

00:42:54.211 --> 00:42:55.441
and you got lucky this time.

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:03.559
I'll go change the ice pack for you.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.089
Hey, pretty boy.

00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:23.846
How much cash do you have?

00:43:24.215 --> 00:43:24.884
None.

00:43:25.493 --> 00:43:26.713
How come you don't?

00:43:27.598 --> 00:43:28.290
Search him!

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.439
Hey!

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:31.572
Stay still!

00:43:33.755 --> 00:43:34.255
Here.

00:43:34.255 --> 00:43:35.499
Didn't you say you had none?

00:43:35.499 --> 00:43:36.974
That's enough for a bottle,

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.739
maybe even a pot!

00:43:38.886 --> 00:43:39.548
Yeah.

00:43:39.548 --> 00:43:40.442
Asshole. You said you had none.

00:43:40.442 --> 00:43:41.179
You liar!

00:43:55.627 --> 00:43:56.500
Hello, patient.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.410
Please have a seat.

00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:05.406
I'm not feeling well, doc.

00:44:06.623 --> 00:44:09.751
Can you treat me?

00:44:10.268 --> 00:44:11.541
It must be my heart that hurts.

00:44:13.552 --> 00:44:14.776
Hey, I'm not playing around.

00:44:15.385 --> 00:44:16.028
I'm busy.

00:44:19.214 --> 00:44:21.097
You're calling me the same way now?

00:44:22.296 --> 00:44:23.828
You just called me Mr. Peng.

00:44:23.939 --> 00:44:25.462
My heart sank.

00:44:26.384 --> 00:44:27.753
I knew you were mad at me.

00:44:32.826 --> 00:44:33.894
Well, don't I have a reason to be mad?

00:44:49.491 --> 00:44:50.930
That guy is your ex, right?

00:44:52.498 --> 00:44:53.494
How could you know?

00:44:55.246 --> 00:44:56.448
I've got good instincts.

00:44:57.297 --> 00:44:58.444
He just came for a trip.

00:44:58.444 --> 00:44:59.599
He's gone back already.

00:45:00.669 --> 00:45:02.533
But he said he'd move here.

00:45:04.009 --> 00:45:05.496
He was just saying that.

00:45:06.381 --> 00:45:09.088
Whether he meant it or not, I don't know.

00:45:09.752 --> 00:45:12.751
But what I do know is
I'm jealous of him, your ex

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:16.984
who could go out with you openly.

00:45:17.962 --> 00:45:19.858
I'm your new boyfriend,

00:45:20.743 --> 00:45:23.338
but where do we see each other?

00:45:23.596 --> 00:45:25.126
Secret rooms, hidden beaches,

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:26.501
or any place no one can find us.

00:45:50.788 --> 00:45:52.798
I'm already exhausted from work.

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:55.164
When I'm tired,

00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:57.855
I want to hug my boyfriend and be clingy.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.396
But with all your conditions,

00:46:05.067 --> 00:46:06.595
I think I'm worn out.

00:46:16.142 --> 00:46:17.086
You know what?

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:20.315
Lava understands me better than you do.

00:46:44.692 --> 00:46:46.084
You're obsessed with your new outfit, huh?

00:46:50.216 --> 00:46:53.644
I just wanted to try on my own clothes
to see if it helps me remember anything.

00:46:55.083 --> 00:46:56.235
But it didn't help.

00:46:58.559 --> 00:46:59.646
It helps a lot.

00:47:00.863 --> 00:47:04.487
It confirms you're an expensive guy.

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:09.531
Or maybe I'm just someone with good taste.

00:47:11.254 --> 00:47:13.734
“Good taste” is for other people
to compliment, not yourself.

00:47:18.825 --> 00:47:22.632
Actually, I haven't properly thanked you

00:47:25.528 --> 00:47:26.921
yet for saving my life.

00:47:29.153 --> 00:47:32.501
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead.

00:47:33.755 --> 00:47:35.490
When you meet your parents,

00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:37.907
share some inheritance with me too.

00:47:56.143 --> 00:47:57.250
You look handsome today.

00:48:01.382 --> 00:48:02.324
I know.

00:48:16.671 --> 00:48:17.406
Wait.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:20.807
Where are you taking me?

00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:35.158
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.887
Yeah.

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:42.124
You know, sometimes I envy you.

00:48:42.714 --> 00:48:45.428
You don't have a past to think about
to remember, or to wonder

00:48:46.254 --> 00:48:48.779
if you did anything wrong.

00:48:49.443 --> 00:48:51.493
It's like you hit a restart button

00:48:51.917 --> 00:48:52.747
This is so unfair.

00:48:54.444 --> 00:48:55.342
I don't think it's good.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.129
I'd rather have memories.

00:48:59.808 --> 00:49:03.586
Being alone, not knowing where I come from

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:09.296
or having anyone in my life, is worse.

00:49:10.329 --> 00:49:12.089
I want to have memories I can look back on.

00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:16.479
Memories, good or bad,

00:49:17.899 --> 00:49:19.563
help me understand who I am now.

00:49:20.799 --> 00:49:22.812
Try having an awful past like mine,

00:49:23.845 --> 00:49:26.990
and then you'll want a delete button
to erase it all.

00:49:30.329 --> 00:49:33.739
Like how I remember you kissed me
and then said you felt nothing?

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:35.720
Are you sulking?

00:49:37.362 --> 00:49:39.555
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

00:49:39.998 --> 00:49:42.502
Yeah, you should be.

00:49:43.019 --> 00:49:44.294
You should blame yourself too.

00:49:46.858 --> 00:49:48.411
I may not have much experience in this,

00:49:49.536 --> 00:49:51.213
but I can tell by feeling.

00:49:51.674 --> 00:49:54.160
What you did wasn't right.

00:49:56.466 --> 00:49:58.224
We've only known each other
for a short while.

00:49:59.405 --> 00:50:01.349
And this is how I have always behaved.

00:50:02.751 --> 00:50:03.678
What do you expect me to do?

00:50:05.264 --> 00:50:06.936
I don't really know what I should feel.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:11.196
But hearing “nothing” hurts.

00:50:11.602 --> 00:50:13.861
Because I really felt nothing at that time.

00:50:14.156 --> 00:50:16.747
You looked that scared and stiff.

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.058
What was I supposed to do?

00:50:23.002 --> 00:50:24.069
Then how about kissing me again?

00:50:27.168 --> 00:50:29.902
Why does it feel like
wearing your own clothes made you more confident?

00:50:30.751 --> 00:50:32.516
Maybe this is the real me.

00:50:34.582 --> 00:50:35.532
You're not scared of me anymore?

00:50:38.613 --> 00:50:41.923
People have to learn from their mistakes.

00:50:44.616 --> 00:50:45.645
It must be more—

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:47.544
I promise I'll help you find your past.

00:52:47.694 --> 00:52:50.892
But for now, I just want you to enjoy the present with me.

00:52:51.003 --> 00:52:53.766
You have to remember that everything is new to Wave.

00:52:53.766 --> 00:52:56.008
He's ready to get attached to anyone who treats him well.

00:52:56.746 --> 00:52:58.778
Is that new doctor hitting on you?

00:52:58.999 --> 00:52:59.927
Maybe he is.

00:53:00.167 --> 00:53:01.689
I think I need to keep some distance from you.

00:53:01.689 --> 00:53:02.614
You're getting too attached to me.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:03.931
I don't understand.

00:53:04.152 --> 00:53:05.066
Did I do something wrong?

00:53:05.656 --> 00:53:07.829
Maybe I don't know as much as I thought I did.

00:53:07.977 --> 00:53:09.392
Just follow your heart.

00:53:09.816 --> 00:53:10.763
Wave.

00:53:12.479 --> 00:53:13.817
I think I have feelings for you.
