00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:19.398
About last night…

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:20.818
Why did you kiss me?

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:22.677
I saw you've been uneasy.

00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:23.898
And you didn't feel anything?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.770
It's just like a one-night thing.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.347
It's like kissing someone at a bar or club.

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:28.602
That guy is your ex, right?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.150
When I'm tired, I want to hug my boyfriend and be clingy.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.717
I think I'm worn out.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.636
I don't really know what I should feel.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.738
But hearing “nothing” hurts.

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.025
Because I really felt nothing at that time.

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:41.313
What was I supposed to do?

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:42.462
Then how about kissing me again?

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.578
It must be more—

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:13.789
Why is your name Lava?

00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:17.066
My dad named me.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:22.135
He said the day I was born
was the hottest day of the year.

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:25.319
And when he took my mom to the hospital,

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.179
he walked like he was crossing a volcano.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.829
So yeah, that's how I got the name Lava.

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:35.506
I thought

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:37.591
you'd say it's because you're hot.

00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:42.662
Well, was I hot last night?

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:48.445
What's your real name then?

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.229
TIWAKORN RAPEEPONG

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.841
Tiwakorn Rapeepong.

00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:06.366
What does it mean?

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.334
“Tiwakorn” means “the sun.”

00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:12.483
And “Rapeepong,”

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:17.452
my dad's family name, means
“descendant of the sun.”

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.208
What do you say?

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.377
Hot both front and back, huh?

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:29.398
I wish I had a real name too.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.236
“Wave” doesn't feel enough.

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:36.239
I don't even know my birthday,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.972
my parents, or my real name.

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:46.625
Everything I have is because of you
and Uncle Peng.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.197
I still hope that someday
someone will come looking for you.

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:08.235
There must be someone out there
who loves and cares about you.

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:16.262
But what if they're all dead?

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:22.594
Maybe the people who hurt me
killed my family too.

00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:26.445
That's why no one's ever come for me.

00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:36.250
Maybe I'll have to stay as Wave forever.

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:43.188
I promise I'll help you find your past.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:48.507
But for now, I just want you to enjoy
the present with me.

00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:53.440
What about the future?

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:57.217
I don't know, and I don't care either.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.161
As long as I'm happy right now,
that's enough.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.090
BANGSAWAN ISLAND SCHOOL

00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:12.776
Wait for me here.

00:05:12.894 --> 00:05:13.743
I'll pick you up this evening.

00:05:14.358 --> 00:05:16.392
Okay, but no rush.

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.303
I'm teaching a classical piano class today.

00:05:18.563 --> 00:05:19.636
It'll probably take a while.

00:05:21.032 --> 00:05:22.165
You're good, you know?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.296
Someone like me could never be a teacher.

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:25.218
I'm too hot-headed.

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:26.426
I wouldn't be able to teach anyone.

00:05:27.562 --> 00:05:28.717
You should try it.

00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:36.254
There's nothing quite like the joy of seeing
a kid happy through music.

00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:38.501
Music, huh?

00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:41.072
I doubt I could do it.

00:05:41.498 --> 00:05:43.397
I can't stay focused long enough
to learn anything properly.

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:46.807
I already know

00:05:47.517 --> 00:05:52.544
you're impatient and get frustrated easily.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.000
Are you subtly insulting me?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.717
No, I'm saying it straight.

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:02.057
Try to calm down sometimes.

00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:04.598
Consider and analyze the consequences.

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:09.920
Got it, Mr. Tiwakorn Rapeepong?

00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:14.197
Whoa, Teacher Wave's spirit
really took over, huh?

00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:16.943
Hello, teacher.

00:06:17.322 --> 00:06:18.785
I forgot my homework.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.132
How are you going to punish this student?

00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:23.188
Hmm? What's the punishment?

00:06:24.158 --> 00:06:24.687
Hey.

00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:25.945
Stop it.

00:06:27.317 --> 00:06:28.810
Aomsin's probably waiting already.

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:30.880
Yes, teacher!

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.617
Yes, sir.

00:06:32.303 --> 00:06:32.977
That's enough.

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:34.420
See you this evening.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.239
Go.

00:06:50.084 --> 00:06:51.941
See you, teacher.

00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:52.801
Go already.

00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:01.983
PHONGSAKORN KIATNIKOM
PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT,
PROMOTE TOURISM, AND STAND AGAINST CORRUPTION.

00:07:08.064 --> 00:07:09.172
Good luck, Peng.

00:07:10.781 --> 00:07:12.715
Thank you. Please vote for number 5.

00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:14.617
Of course. You've got my vote.

00:07:20.243 --> 00:07:21.874
You're already the people's favorite.

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:23.817
You don't even need to campaign.

00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:26.543
They just say that.

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:28.560
Who knows if they'll actually vote for me.

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.536
Look at my opponent.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.767
His whole family's in politics on this island.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.055
How can I compete with that?

00:07:36.634 --> 00:07:39.425
If you give up before you even start,
why run at all?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.516
Come on, have some faith.

00:07:41.516 --> 00:07:43.077
Life is all about hope.

00:07:43.077 --> 00:07:44.006
Don't lecture me.

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:47.063
Just fix that banner.
It's not centered.

00:07:47.418 --> 00:07:48.581
Make sure it's centered.

00:07:54.804 --> 00:07:55.546
Is it centered now?

00:07:57.178 --> 00:07:58.947
Yeah, it looks good.

00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:09.671
HONEST. SAY IT, DO IT.
FAITH IN ASAWATHAI, READY TO SERVE AND PROSPER.
CHETTA ASAWATHAI.

00:08:13.883 --> 00:08:15.181
I'll go grab more banners.

00:08:22.256 --> 00:08:25.310
This side job outside the resort
should come with extra pay.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.378
Of course. I'll pay you.

00:08:28.496 --> 00:08:29.912
I wouldn't make you work for free.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.941
What are you saving up for, anyway?

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:35.842
For Wave?

00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:43.282
You slept with him already, huh?

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:50.511
Yeah.

00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:53.436
Whatever you're going to do, be careful.

00:08:55.613 --> 00:08:56.402
Careful of what?

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.307
We're young. It's normal.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.093
You have to remember that
everything is new to Wave.

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:05.652
The way you get close to him…

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.175
he'll feel deeply about everything you do.

00:09:08.956 --> 00:09:10.741
Are you sure you're ready?

00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:15.388
Ready for what?

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:17.174
Ready to be his whole world.

00:09:18.783 --> 00:09:20.998
If we don't know where he came from,

00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:22.675
from now on,

00:09:23.692 --> 00:09:25.993
you're the most important person in his life.

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:34.573
I don't think so.

00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:37.231
People don't get attached that fast.

00:09:38.106 --> 00:09:39.668
You're underestimating this.

00:09:40.378 --> 00:09:42.575
You've got experience. You're vaccinated.

00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:44.707
He's not someone you meet at a bar

00:09:45.157 --> 00:09:47.346
and forget the next morning.

00:09:48.695 --> 00:09:49.701
Look at him.

00:09:50.387 --> 00:09:52.737
He's ready to get attached to anyone
who treats him well.

00:10:12.452 --> 00:10:15.158
Excuse me, uncle,
have you seen Aomsin?

00:10:15.608 --> 00:10:18.120
I had a piano lesson scheduled with him.

00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:20.954
I have been waiting for a while,
but he hasn't shown up yet.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.786
I haven't seen him.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:27.701
He usually comes early.

00:10:29.831 --> 00:10:31.741
Maybe you can go check at his house.

00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:32.797
It's not far.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.004
Aomsin.

00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:02.059
Aomsin.

00:11:04.993 --> 00:11:05.901
Aomsin.

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:09.809
Aomsin.

00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:05.776
What are you doing?!

00:12:05.776 --> 00:12:07.280
Hey! What are you doing to me?

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.462
Ugh! Ouch!

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.383
Who are you?

00:12:10.383 --> 00:12:11.728
Who are you?!

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.029
Dad!

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.817
That's my dad!

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:24.191
Why didn't you show up
for today's piano class?

00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:25.602
I came to check.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.331
I told him he's not going.

00:12:30.828 --> 00:12:32.208
It's useless.

00:12:32.634 --> 00:12:35.353
What poor kid learns piano?

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.869
Of course he can.

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.599
Music has no class barrier.

00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:42.142
And can it make money?

00:12:42.142 --> 00:12:44.015
He might become
a world-class musician one day.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.982
My dad said, “Stop being delusional.”

00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:53.465
I just want him to have a good job,

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:55.814
not become a musician like me.

00:12:56.122 --> 00:12:57.467
I've already suffered enough.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.649
But he's really talented.

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.275
I'm sure he'll go far.

00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:02.959
Hey!

00:13:03.693 --> 00:13:06.198
Don't fill the kid's head
with a hopeless dream.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.641
Let him face reality.

00:13:18.977 --> 00:13:21.748
At the hospital,
we mostly get emergency cases like this.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.804
They're mostly motorcycle accidents.

00:13:24.798 --> 00:13:27.244
Tourists aren't used to the island roads.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.783
Not just the tourists, actually.

00:13:30.564 --> 00:13:31.847
I'm even scared of those roads.

00:13:32.249 --> 00:13:34.040
They're like roller coasters.

00:13:34.158 --> 00:13:35.666
I can barely shift gears in time.

00:13:36.518 --> 00:13:37.474
You'll get used to it.

00:13:38.042 --> 00:13:40.997
I think you'll need a few scratches to learn.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:45.667
I guess I'll need you
to show me how to handle it then.

00:13:46.613 --> 00:13:47.646
Anytime.

00:13:47.646 --> 00:13:49.057
I'll take you on a wild ride myself.

00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:50.858
You said it.

00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:54.705
Hello, Dr. Wut.

00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:59.247
Hi, Mr. Peng.

00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:04.060
This is Dr. Mai, our new doctor.

00:14:04.462 --> 00:14:05.855
He just transferred here.

00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:08.000
Hello.

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:10.307
Hello. You're…?

00:14:12.437 --> 00:14:13.168
I'm Peng.

00:14:13.783 --> 00:14:14.730
I'm Dr. Mai.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.216
I'm the new doctor here,

00:14:16.216 --> 00:14:19.320
and my name is also Mai,
which literally means “new.”

00:14:21.804 --> 00:14:24.501
I'm sorry. I know doctor jokes are a bit dry.

00:14:24.643 --> 00:14:26.224
It's not as sharp as a scalpel.

00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:30.933
Dr. Wut, how about dinner tonight?

00:14:31.146 --> 00:14:32.932
I'd love to try some southern dishes—

00:14:32.932 --> 00:14:35.155
Yellow Curry, Fermented Fish Curry,

00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:37.434
Stir-Fried Sataw Beans,
and Southern Spicy Herb Rice Salad.

00:14:39.232 --> 00:14:40.704
With that much food,
please be careful.

00:14:41.035 --> 00:14:42.397
Your stomach might not be able to handle it.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.997
Southern dishes are strong in flavor.

00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:49.626
Don't worry. I came well-prepared.

00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:54.911
Alright then, I'll take you.

00:14:56.615 --> 00:14:58.848
But today,
I need to take care of some business first.

00:15:01.711 --> 00:15:03.425
Nice to meet you, Mr. Peng.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.552
Likewise, Dr. Mai.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.129
Welcome to the island.

00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:09.262
If there's anything I can help with,
just let me know.

00:15:09.262 --> 00:15:11.312
I work closely with locals,
taking care of them,

00:15:11.501 --> 00:15:13.588
and your job is also to take care of them.

00:15:14.322 --> 00:15:18.869
So, taking care of the doctor
is my responsibility too.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.543
Then I'll take my leave.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.689
See you later, Doctor.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.002
SHOWDOWN OF THE LEGENDARY DUO!

00:16:25.244 --> 00:16:25.996
Wave.

00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:30.733
I went to the school,

00:16:31.064 --> 00:16:32.842
and the janitor told me to follow you here.

00:16:33.221 --> 00:16:34.156
I'm sorry.

00:16:34.582 --> 00:16:36.451
I took a bit too long
convincing Aomsin's dad.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.603
He won't let his kid learn.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.242
Why are you bothering so much?

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:43.805
I can't let that happen.

00:16:44.515 --> 00:16:47.253
Are you just going to let his parents
decide a life he doesn't want?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.031
Just because they've fallen
or made mistakes

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.602
doesn't mean their child
should stop chasing their dream.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.082
You don't even know him.

00:16:54.484 --> 00:16:56.280
You can't make decisions for him.

00:16:56.564 --> 00:16:59.457
Music might not even be
the most important thing in his life.

00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:02.614
Poor people don't have time
to indulge in art.

00:17:03.348 --> 00:17:04.810
They have to work to survive.

00:17:05.756 --> 00:17:09.342
But I think Aomsin deserves a chance
to live a life he chooses.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.060
And if it were you,

00:17:11.486 --> 00:17:13.446
I bet you wouldn't let anyone
decide your life either.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.794
Right, Mr. Tiwakorn Rapeepong?

00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:21.057
I think you're not the kind to just obey.

00:17:23.258 --> 00:17:24.156
I'm not a dog.

00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:26.261
And stop assuming things about me.

00:17:27.562 --> 00:17:28.729
You don't know me that well yet.

00:17:51.694 --> 00:17:53.539
Is the new doctor hitting on you?

00:17:55.554 --> 00:17:56.636
Do I need to be jealous?

00:17:58.136 --> 00:17:59.045
I'm not sure.

00:17:59.918 --> 00:18:01.172
Maybe he is.

00:18:01.642 --> 00:18:02.548
He's still single.

00:18:06.466 --> 00:18:07.908
But you're not single anymore.

00:18:08.445 --> 00:18:09.825
You've got a boyfriend.

00:18:12.848 --> 00:18:13.727
Really?

00:18:16.055 --> 00:18:19.487
Why do I feel like
I don't have one at all?

00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:32.290
Are you still sulking?

00:18:35.738 --> 00:18:36.985
I'm not sulking.

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:40.899
Maybe it's just that I've gotten used to it.

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:45.399
But I don't know how long that will last.

00:18:48.713 --> 00:18:50.038
Why are you saying this?

00:18:50.754 --> 00:18:52.238
You know what I've been through.

00:18:55.664 --> 00:18:58.497
I know you came from a pressuring family.

00:18:59.303 --> 00:19:00.495
But now you've broken free.

00:19:02.353 --> 00:19:03.872
You're already bold, so go all the way.

00:19:06.469 --> 00:19:07.539
You wouldn't understand

00:19:08.054 --> 00:19:09.777
because your life
never had to prove anything.

00:19:11.232 --> 00:19:12.431
Why did you say that?

00:19:12.856 --> 00:19:17.149
You don't know what I went through
to finally tell my parents.

00:19:18.313 --> 00:19:21.412
If you can't do it yourself,
don't judge others.

00:19:37.766 --> 00:19:38.551
Give it to me.

00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:40.165
I'll cut it for you.

00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:42.622
No need.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.357
Let me do it. Stay still.

00:19:45.648 --> 00:19:48.406
No. I can do it myself.

00:19:49.234 --> 00:19:49.998
Don't be stubborn.

00:19:50.535 --> 00:19:53.412
Look. Your nails are so long.

00:19:54.173 --> 00:19:55.104
You need to take good care of yourself.

00:19:55.104 --> 00:19:55.625
Got it?

00:19:57.662 --> 00:19:58.634
Stay still.

00:20:13.288 --> 00:20:17.858
Watching the sunset every day
is my kind of happiness.

00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:21.778
Some days the sky is orange.

00:20:22.517 --> 00:20:24.095
Some days the sky's really overcast.

00:20:25.886 --> 00:20:29.028
One day, I even saw it purple
with a hint of pink.

00:20:31.401 --> 00:20:32.829
Pink sky, huh?

00:20:33.501 --> 00:20:34.823
Did you take something or what?

00:20:35.898 --> 00:20:37.315
I'm serious.

00:20:39.554 --> 00:20:43.475
You know, the beauty of nature,

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.919
the atmosphere,

00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:48.096
and the charm of this island

00:20:50.172 --> 00:20:51.680
make me think…

00:20:53.449 --> 00:20:54.117
Think what?

00:20:55.595 --> 00:21:01.221
Maybe I don't need to know
who I am anymore.

00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:04.858
Right now, I'm happy.

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.902
I'm with nature,

00:21:07.104 --> 00:21:09.024
finding joy in teaching music,

00:21:10.882 --> 00:21:12.439
and I've got…

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:15.826
Got what?

00:21:17.304 --> 00:21:19.084
I've got my own sun.

00:21:27.843 --> 00:21:30.842
Ugh! That's cutting into me.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.297
What were you even cutting?

00:21:34.297 --> 00:21:35.323
I'll do it myself.

00:21:41.973 --> 00:21:44.550
What? You didn't even flinch.

00:22:06.982 --> 00:22:08.406
Wave, what are you doing?

00:22:14.406 --> 00:22:17.140
Wave, what are you even doing?

00:22:20.364 --> 00:22:24.616
I like touching you, feeling your skin.

00:22:25.892 --> 00:22:27.083
It feels soft.

00:22:31.404 --> 00:22:33.195
Soft? It's so rough.

00:22:38.172 --> 00:22:42.116
But I think it feels warm.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.498
Wave, you're tickling me!

00:22:59.622 --> 00:23:01.631
Wave, I'm hot!

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:06.908
Hot?

00:23:07.826 --> 00:23:08.507
Yeah.

00:23:09.112 --> 00:23:10.216
Then take off your top.

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:12.413
I'll take mine off too.

00:23:25.329 --> 00:23:26.015
Wave!

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.144
Wave!

00:23:27.816 --> 00:23:28.913
Wave, no!

00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:32.613
What's wrong with you?

00:23:35.344 --> 00:23:37.100
Did I do something to upset you?

00:23:37.884 --> 00:23:38.976
You can tell me.

00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:40.719
Nothing's wrong.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.766
Uncle Peng kept me busy.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.087
I'm not in the mood.

00:23:51.453 --> 00:23:53.052
Then we can just lie down and hug.

00:24:10.586 --> 00:24:12.537
I can't sleep. You go ahead.

00:24:16.545 --> 00:24:17.926
What's wrong with you?

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.994
You're acting weird today.

00:24:24.002 --> 00:24:28.069
Nothing, just thinking about some things.

00:24:30.442 --> 00:24:32.056
I'll go sleep in the living room.

00:24:44.898 --> 00:24:49.408
(He's not someone you meet at a bar
and forget the next morning.)

00:24:49.968 --> 00:24:51.119
(Look at him.)

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:53.883
(He's ready to get attached to anyone
who treats him well.)

00:25:12.584 --> 00:25:13.161
Hook.

00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:13.689
Jab.

00:25:13.689 --> 00:25:14.281
Hook.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.086
Hook.

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:15.940
Hook.

00:25:16.567 --> 00:25:17.671
Watch out!

00:25:17.671 --> 00:25:18.200
Jab.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.747
Straight.

00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:20.143
Straight.

00:25:20.143 --> 00:25:22.078
Come on. 2,3,4,5,6!

00:25:22.078 --> 00:25:22.823
Kick!

00:25:23.539 --> 00:25:24.708
Caught it!

00:25:27.193 --> 00:25:27.971
Ouch!

00:25:30.009 --> 00:25:31.494
You serious?

00:25:32.076 --> 00:25:34.969
Even if you're fighting as an amateur,
he's way more of a fighter than you.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.600
I want to try.

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:39.056
If I don't, I won't know.

00:25:39.056 --> 00:25:39.808
I want to win.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.286
I want the money!

00:25:41.286 --> 00:25:42.428
What are you going to do with it?

00:25:42.428 --> 00:25:43.184
Get married or something?

00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:44.933
Married, my ass.

00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:47.401
I'll use it to buy back my dad's motorbike.

00:25:47.401 --> 00:25:49.946
Then why don't you borrow from your mom
or Uncle Peng?

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:53.694
Ask for money from two people
who look down on me?

00:25:54.075 --> 00:25:55.161
I won't ask for help.

00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:56.172
I'll do it myself.

00:25:56.575 --> 00:25:57.663
You studied architecture, didn't you?

00:25:57.663 --> 00:25:58.610
Why aren't you building houses?

00:25:59.327 --> 00:26:00.345
Why the hell are you boxing?

00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:04.014
You've still got a lot of training to do, dude.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.375
By the way,

00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:11.093
do you like Kratae?

00:26:12.459 --> 00:26:13.941
Why? Are you scared of me?

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.804
Asshole!

00:26:16.185 --> 00:26:17.590
What the hell could I be scared of?

00:26:18.396 --> 00:26:19.604
Look at yourself.

00:26:19.738 --> 00:26:21.642
I'm cool and stylish like this.

00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:23.213
Anyone would like me.

00:26:23.213 --> 00:26:26.015
I thought you said
you didn't know how to box.

00:26:26.015 --> 00:26:27.470
Damn, my mouth is full of sand.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.621
So you're not into her?

00:26:31.651 --> 00:26:33.663
No. She's not my type.

00:26:34.088 --> 00:26:36.204
Even this cute,
she's still not your type?

00:26:36.674 --> 00:26:37.739
Then what's your type?

00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:48.028
How do you feel when playing guitar?

00:26:48.431 --> 00:26:51.178
I feel like I don't need anything.

00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:54.345
Making others happy makes me feel at ease.

00:26:54.658 --> 00:26:57.896
That's how Aomsin feels
when he plays piano.

00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:00.954
Don't you want your son to be happy?

00:27:04.715 --> 00:27:06.321
I understand your concerns,

00:27:06.724 --> 00:27:10.644
but at least let Aomsin do what he loves.

00:27:11.249 --> 00:27:12.937
Whatever the result,

00:27:13.922 --> 00:27:17.684
it's better than letting him be sad
without trying.

00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:24.613
Wave.

00:27:29.091 --> 00:27:29.689
Wave.

00:27:40.086 --> 00:27:41.127
Don't worry.

00:27:41.552 --> 00:27:44.471
Your type and mine are totally different.

00:27:44.471 --> 00:27:45.879
No overlaps.

00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:48.073
Great.

00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:51.734
Then I'll step up my offensive game.

00:27:52.383 --> 00:27:53.287
Whoa.

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:55.562
Come on, practice more if you want to win.

00:27:55.562 --> 00:27:56.198
Sure.

00:27:56.198 --> 00:27:56.940
Get up.

00:28:00.186 --> 00:28:01.217
One hit!

00:28:01.217 --> 00:28:03.694
You weren't careful enough.

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.318
What?

00:28:09.214 --> 00:28:12.154
Not “what,” Wave. That's not it.

00:28:12.803 --> 00:28:14.393
High pitch.

00:28:14.393 --> 00:28:15.952
“Whaaaat?”

00:28:16.198 --> 00:28:17.081
Whaaaat?

00:28:17.215 --> 00:28:18.990
Yeah, that's it.

00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:19.945
What does it mean?

00:28:20.172 --> 00:28:23.162
It means, “what's up?”

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.251
What's up?

00:28:25.251 --> 00:28:26.110
Exactly.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.117
Good thing I learned Southern Thai.

00:28:29.632 --> 00:28:31.147
Now I can understand the locals better.

00:28:39.637 --> 00:28:40.857
It's evening now.

00:28:41.215 --> 00:28:42.504
Where are Lava and Uncle Peng?

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.800
Why haven't they returned yet?

00:28:46.285 --> 00:28:48.395
Today there's a candle procession
at the temple.

00:28:48.574 --> 00:28:51.913
The Chief is probably there campaigning,
and Lava is likely there too

00:28:51.913 --> 00:28:54.262
since everyone from around here is going.

00:28:57.915 --> 00:28:58.766
Finished.

00:28:59.639 --> 00:29:01.217
Thank you.

00:29:14.887 --> 00:29:16.972
Pick some flowers, incense,
and candles for me.

00:29:18.136 --> 00:29:20.224
If you've got hands, then use them.

00:29:20.224 --> 00:29:21.900
I want you to pick them for me.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.532
Making merit together this life,
next life we'll be born as a couple.

00:29:25.532 --> 00:29:27.375
No chasing, no fuss.

00:29:28.091 --> 00:29:30.397
But I just want to meet you this one lifetime.

00:29:34.024 --> 00:29:35.508
Here you are, Lava.

00:29:35.978 --> 00:29:37.345
Wave isn't coming?

00:29:38.979 --> 00:29:40.611
He's sick. He's resting at home.

00:29:41.954 --> 00:29:43.367
Is he okay?

00:29:43.725 --> 00:29:45.262
Honestly, I'm worried.

00:29:45.441 --> 00:29:47.903
If worst case, he forgets everything,

00:29:48.172 --> 00:29:51.442
Uncle Peng and you will really have to be
his new family.

00:29:51.442 --> 00:29:53.696
Then when will you be part of my family?

00:29:57.614 --> 00:29:58.244
Here.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.170
Oh?

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.605
Giving me flowers like this,
you've got feelings, huh?

00:30:04.008 --> 00:30:06.502
Even for the dead, we give flowers.

00:30:14.481 --> 00:30:16.396
Whoa! You know what?

00:30:17.135 --> 00:30:19.541
This kind of woman is my dream woman.

00:30:19.899 --> 00:30:21.682
She keeps up with me perfectly.

00:30:24.302 --> 00:30:28.294
Homage to the Buddha,
the Worthy.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.028
Peng, are you campaigning?

00:30:39.162 --> 00:30:42.333
You never miss temple events or ordinations.

00:30:42.938 --> 00:30:44.145
I'm not campaigning.

00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:45.912
I always help at the temple here.

00:30:47.166 --> 00:30:51.541
Anyone would be lucky
to have you as a son-in-law.

00:30:52.101 --> 00:30:54.392
By the way, do you have a girlfriend?

00:30:55.914 --> 00:30:56.960
Not yet.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.384
Right now,
I'm focusing on building myself up.

00:30:58.832 --> 00:31:02.886
If not, then I'll reserve my daughter for you.

00:31:03.781 --> 00:31:06.247
One day, come eat at my house.

00:31:06.381 --> 00:31:07.100
Sure.

00:31:07.458 --> 00:31:08.402
We're heading off.

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:18.203
Eh, Mr. Peng?

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.554
You're the temple coordinator here too?

00:31:20.666 --> 00:31:21.824
I see you everywhere.

00:31:22.899 --> 00:31:24.348
I usually help here anyway.

00:31:24.684 --> 00:31:26.274
Good. Keep it up.

00:31:27.617 --> 00:31:28.426
Thank you.

00:31:56.172 --> 00:31:59.551
Is it always this cool in the evenings?

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.900
Yes, it's always like this.

00:32:02.348 --> 00:32:04.453
A bit more and it'll turn into a storm.

00:32:04.632 --> 00:32:05.700
True.

00:32:15.462 --> 00:32:16.385
Oops.

00:32:18.288 --> 00:32:18.962
Tum!

00:32:19.477 --> 00:32:20.337
There's so much space around.

00:32:20.337 --> 00:32:21.646
Why are you bumping into me?

00:32:22.474 --> 00:32:24.269
I want to walk beside you

00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:25.880
so I can pile up merit and get to heaven.

00:32:26.529 --> 00:32:29.623
I'll definitely get to heaven,
but I'll kick you down to hell.

00:32:30.877 --> 00:32:32.981
How about a date at the Brass Pan
straight to hell?

00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:36.273
Hey, don't sigh yet.

00:32:39.945 --> 00:32:40.445
Hey?

00:32:40.445 --> 00:32:41.282
How did you get here?

00:32:43.208 --> 00:32:44.362
I biked here.

00:32:48.168 --> 00:32:50.172
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming to the temple?

00:32:50.172 --> 00:32:51.110
I didn't plan to.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.357
Tum invited me.

00:32:52.357 --> 00:32:53.128
Then what's wrong with you?

00:32:53.419 --> 00:32:54.464
Why are you avoiding me?

00:32:57.151 --> 00:32:58.674
It's not something to talk about now.

00:32:59.055 --> 00:33:00.702
Wait until I finish the three rounds
of the candle procession.

00:33:01.083 --> 00:33:03.037
Since when did you get so religious?

00:33:03.888 --> 00:33:05.656
You usually don't behave yourself.

00:33:06.104 --> 00:33:07.414
Now you're suddenly scared of sin?

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:26.921
I don't like it when you do this.

00:33:28.327 --> 00:33:30.000
If you're mad, just say so.

00:33:31.775 --> 00:33:33.281
I need to keep some distance from you.

00:33:39.962 --> 00:33:40.648
Why?

00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:42.829
Why do we have to keep our distance?

00:33:45.061 --> 00:33:46.217
You're getting too attached to me.

00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:48.130
What do you mean?

00:33:49.167 --> 00:33:50.230
After we slept together,

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.387
I could tell you wanted something more.

00:33:52.809 --> 00:33:53.952
But you're not ready yet.

00:33:54.057 --> 00:33:55.313
You're still fragile.

00:33:55.313 --> 00:33:56.632
Anything that comes your way
could shake you.

00:33:56.632 --> 00:33:57.637
I don't want to take advantage of that.

00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:00.431
Take advantage?

00:34:00.765 --> 00:34:02.624
I'm willing to be with you.

00:34:02.624 --> 00:34:04.361
I don't want you to get too attached to me.

00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:05.800
I can't even handle myself right now.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.427
How can I handle someone else's feelings?

00:34:08.165 --> 00:34:09.536
You can't just treat me like this.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:10.534
Why not?

00:34:10.727 --> 00:34:11.612
This is who I am.

00:34:11.735 --> 00:34:13.181
I've always been like this.

00:34:13.462 --> 00:34:17.127
I think right now we should focus on
getting you back home instead.

00:34:24.264 --> 00:34:27.107
Oh, Wave, you're here?

00:34:27.406 --> 00:34:29.028
Lava said you were sick.

00:34:38.484 --> 00:34:41.233
Yeah, I'm sick.

00:34:44.221 --> 00:34:45.761
Instead of taking care of myself,

00:34:46.572 --> 00:34:47.882
I went and made myself worse.

00:34:51.046 --> 00:34:52.164
It's all my fault.

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:56.260
I brought this pain on myself.

00:35:05.216 --> 00:35:06.095
I'll head back now.

00:35:10.324 --> 00:35:10.824
Hey.

00:35:11.572 --> 00:35:12.611
Eh? Wave.

00:35:13.173 --> 00:35:14.615
Have some tea with us before you go.

00:35:14.615 --> 00:35:15.572
What's the rush?

00:35:19.843 --> 00:35:21.528
You two fought, didn't you?

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.821
How about talking it out at the tea shop?

00:35:25.858 --> 00:35:26.577
Some other time.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.521
I'm exhausted from boxing practice today.

00:35:36.837 --> 00:35:39.383
Shall we go rehearse
the tea ceremony first, babe?

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:44.509
Sure, but mind if I splash it in your face too?

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:45.545
I want to see

00:35:45.826 --> 00:35:49.608
how long a shameless guy like you
can keep chasing me.

00:35:49.819 --> 00:35:51.798
As longggg as it takes,

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.739
long enough to stand the heat.

00:35:56.323 --> 00:35:57.299
You're going to treat me or what?

00:36:01.572 --> 00:36:03.796
Of course. At my level, I always treat.

00:36:03.796 --> 00:36:04.494
Right!

00:36:22.024 --> 00:36:24.290
Technically we're not supposed to sell
on Buddhist holidays,

00:36:24.501 --> 00:36:26.171
but I feel bad for you.

00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:28.897
Seeing you walk in with tears in your eyes,

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.030
a heartbreak champion like me
will give you some advice tonight.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.117
I don't understand.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.285
Did I do something wrong?

00:36:37.217 --> 00:36:38.718
It's me. I'm the one who caught feelings.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.880
Why is he scared I'll get hurt?

00:36:41.776 --> 00:36:43.495
It's not like I asked anyone
to take care of me.

00:36:46.144 --> 00:36:51.572
Maybe he thinks you're too soft,
inexperienced or something.

00:36:52.359 --> 00:36:54.637
But honestly,
I think he was trying to protect you.

00:36:54.637 --> 00:36:55.685
Protect me?!

00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:57.379
More like being selfish!

00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:00.063
Someone like him
never thinks about anyone else.

00:37:00.292 --> 00:37:01.003
True.

00:37:01.572 --> 00:37:02.968
I totally agree.

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:06.666
Just another jerk who takes advantage
when you're vulnerable!

00:37:10.305 --> 00:37:11.004
Exactly!

00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:14.864
By the way, you still haven't told me
who broke your heart.

00:37:15.971 --> 00:37:16.849
You don't need to know.

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:18.730
He told me to forget him,

00:37:19.152 --> 00:37:20.721
so I'll drink to forget.

00:37:23.393 --> 00:37:24.570
Hey, that's my drink.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:25.212
That's mine.

00:37:25.212 --> 00:37:25.902
Chill out.

00:37:26.219 --> 00:37:26.858
That's mine.

00:37:26.858 --> 00:37:27.358
Let go!

00:37:27.358 --> 00:37:28.666
It's a Buddhist day, you know.

00:37:50.997 --> 00:37:51.884
Why aren't you asleep yet?

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:56.853
Wave followed me to the temple,

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.176
and we got into a small argument.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.446
Now I've just found out
he's not home yet.

00:38:04.221 --> 00:38:05.033
What were you fighting about?

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.453
I told him not to get too attached to me.

00:38:10.314 --> 00:38:12.312
I can't take responsibility for his life.

00:38:13.226 --> 00:38:15.634
Then he rode off somewhere.

00:38:16.126 --> 00:38:17.392
I'd better go find him.

00:38:17.849 --> 00:38:19.915
Yeah, you should.

00:38:20.618 --> 00:38:22.072
We took him in.

00:38:22.564 --> 00:38:23.794
We must look after him the best we can.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.261
Lava.

00:38:32.775 --> 00:38:34.980
Maybe I don't know as much
as I thought I did.

00:38:35.718 --> 00:38:36.996
I gave you advice,

00:38:37.172 --> 00:38:38.537
but I can't even handle myself.

00:38:39.574 --> 00:38:41.454
If you meet someone
who makes you feel good,

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:43.756
follow your heart.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.104
Don't overthink it.

00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:49.245
He might not wait for you forever.

00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:11.416
COLLECTION: MEMORY

00:39:15.547 --> 00:39:16.369
Chief,

00:39:18.935 --> 00:39:20.288
kaya toast delivery.

00:39:35.319 --> 00:39:36.871
I know you love this place.

00:39:38.013 --> 00:39:39.256
It's not too sweet,

00:39:39.854 --> 00:39:40.794
and no worries about calories.

00:39:43.835 --> 00:39:45.605
I thought you'd gone home already.

00:39:53.145 --> 00:39:54.220
Didn't you say you wanted me here?

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:56.045
Well, here I am.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.066
Hey, do you really think I'd dump
you for the new doctor?

00:40:07.916 --> 00:40:08.815
I don't know.

00:40:10.292 --> 00:40:12.616
I just feel like I deserve it.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.840
We've been together for so long.

00:40:15.561 --> 00:40:17.163
Do you still not know me?

00:40:18.376 --> 00:40:20.079
I've only known that guy for a few days.

00:40:20.923 --> 00:40:22.972
You think I'd throw away
a year‑long relationship for that?

00:40:26.136 --> 00:40:27.663
I didn't mean it like that.

00:40:28.964 --> 00:40:30.120
I just get scared.

00:40:34.725 --> 00:40:36.682
I just have to get mad sometimes,

00:40:37.666 --> 00:40:40.800
so you'll know I still have feelings,

00:40:42.944 --> 00:40:45.447
not just agreeing to your conditions.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.757
You can be mad at me. I get it.

00:40:50.986 --> 00:40:52.844
You have every right to.

00:40:53.494 --> 00:40:56.572
You've put up with my nonsense all this time,

00:40:57.627 --> 00:41:00.529
and I know how lucky I am
that you chose me.

00:41:02.427 --> 00:41:05.037
Yeah, you're super lucky.

00:41:06.355 --> 00:41:08.042
You know how many people
are lining up to flirt with me?

00:41:09.413 --> 00:41:10.152
Oh really?

00:41:11.572 --> 00:41:13.589
Then why did you choose me?

00:41:14.679 --> 00:41:15.849
Wait. You want me to flatter you now?

00:41:19.663 --> 00:41:20.747
Just a little, please.

00:41:22.399 --> 00:41:24.028
I need my confidence back.

00:41:29.833 --> 00:41:33.706
I like how serious you are when you work,

00:41:36.817 --> 00:41:41.635
and how cute you get when you're in love.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.957
Then stay at my resort tonight.

00:41:49.012 --> 00:41:50.472
Call it a small step,

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:54.809
but I promise I'll take a bigger,

00:41:55.952 --> 00:41:57.334
steadier one next time,

00:41:58.863 --> 00:42:00.462
even straight to your doorstep.

00:42:05.683 --> 00:42:06.502
Is it good?

00:42:53.941 --> 00:42:54.591
Honey.

00:42:55.319 --> 00:42:56.646
All I can do is accept the pain…

00:42:58.505 --> 00:42:59.423
Honey. Where is Wave?

00:43:03.419 --> 00:43:03.919
Wave!

00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:05.929
Wave!

00:43:07.904 --> 00:43:08.452
Wave!

00:43:18.683 --> 00:43:19.665
Why are you doing this?

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.709
Go home.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.965
I'm not going back.

00:43:22.685 --> 00:43:24.901
It's my life. I can take care of myself.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.177
Don't talk big.

00:43:26.851 --> 00:43:27.873
You can't even remember who you are.

00:43:27.873 --> 00:43:28.882
What could you possibly
take responsibility for?

00:43:28.975 --> 00:43:30.274
Then why do you even care?

00:43:31.203 --> 00:43:33.795
You don't want me to get attached
or feel anything,

00:43:34.143 --> 00:43:35.399
so just let me get drunk here.

00:43:36.372 --> 00:43:39.129
I can sleep at Honey's place tonight.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.863
Or maybe I should just move in here,

00:43:45.092 --> 00:43:46.332
so I'll stop being a burden,

00:43:46.843 --> 00:43:48.942
both to you and to your heart.

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:50.602
Don't act tough.

00:43:51.299 --> 00:43:52.459
Go home with me.

00:43:54.852 --> 00:43:56.267
You really want me to go home?

00:43:58.265 --> 00:43:59.391
If you do,

00:44:00.622 --> 00:44:01.983
then do as I say.

00:44:02.912 --> 00:44:03.680
What?

00:44:12.675 --> 00:44:13.382
Kiss me.

00:44:15.636 --> 00:44:16.483
Come on, Wave.

00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:18.981
Prove it.

00:44:20.468 --> 00:44:22.116
Prove that you really
don't feel anything for me.

00:44:24.904 --> 00:44:25.751
What does that have to do with anything?

00:44:27.284 --> 00:44:30.514
If I say it does, then it does.

00:44:43.783 --> 00:44:50.500
Don't you ever feel a little something for me,
Mr. Tiwakorn Rapeepong?

00:44:59.769 --> 00:45:01.191
Go home with me right now.

00:45:01.191 --> 00:45:02.124
Uncle Peng is waiting.

00:45:03.077 --> 00:45:04.102
You just don't have the guts.

00:45:04.799 --> 00:45:08.492
Who's really the coward
and the weak one here?

00:45:09.977 --> 00:45:11.178
I'm not arguing with you.

00:45:11.526 --> 00:45:13.117
You're too drunk to even walk home.

00:45:13.303 --> 00:45:15.061
Go home with me. Now!

00:45:16.292 --> 00:45:18.628
I came here alone. I'll go home alone.

00:45:23.948 --> 00:45:24.622
Wave!

00:45:30.659 --> 00:45:32.512
Wave, come out!

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.975
I'm not joking!

00:45:37.065 --> 00:45:37.931
Wave!

00:45:38.651 --> 00:45:39.934
I'll count down.

00:45:41.212 --> 00:45:44.088
If you don't come out, I'm leaving!

00:45:49.269 --> 00:45:50.023
Five!

00:45:50.952 --> 00:45:52.475
You know this area is haunted, right?

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.581
The ghosts here are vicious.

00:45:56.138 --> 00:45:56.936
Four!

00:45:57.534 --> 00:45:58.381
People said

00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:00.384
someone once fell from a palm tree
and died here.

00:46:00.384 --> 00:46:02.007
The body was a mess.

00:46:02.588 --> 00:46:04.221
You should watch out.

00:46:04.802 --> 00:46:05.630
Three!

00:46:06.838 --> 00:46:08.202
Rumors say

00:46:08.736 --> 00:46:11.064
there are venomous snakes around here.

00:46:11.064 --> 00:46:12.862
Pythons are as big as a person.

00:46:12.862 --> 00:46:14.303
It could swallow you whole.

00:46:14.303 --> 00:46:15.708
Be careful!

00:46:17.102 --> 00:46:18.314
Two!

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.602
The forecast said there's a storm coming.

00:46:21.602 --> 00:46:24.228
It's a freaking strong one.

00:46:24.228 --> 00:46:25.813
You'll get blown away for sure.

00:46:25.813 --> 00:46:28.246
Strongest storm yet, I swear.

00:46:31.917 --> 00:46:32.565
One!

00:46:33.053 --> 00:46:36.282
Fine! Tomorrow I'll come check
what's left of you —

00:46:36.372 --> 00:46:38.125
whether a ghost got your neck,

00:46:38.125 --> 00:46:39.418
snake ate you,

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.463
or the storm swept you away.

00:46:41.928 --> 00:46:43.387
You'll get blown away!

00:46:44.084 --> 00:46:45.230
I'm heading back!

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:49.101
Zero!

00:47:24.959 --> 00:47:25.927
Wave.

00:47:28.715 --> 00:47:29.758
I'm sorry.

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.852
I didn't mean to yell at you.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.108
I didn't want to scold you.

00:47:43.291 --> 00:47:44.041
But it's just…

00:47:50.755 --> 00:47:52.155
I think I really do have feelings for you.

00:47:56.049 --> 00:47:58.031
I've really started falling for you.

00:48:00.587 --> 00:48:02.447
But I don't want you to fall too deep for me

00:48:03.609 --> 00:48:04.959
because I'm a jerk.

00:48:05.657 --> 00:48:07.144
I don't want to hurt you.

00:48:08.817 --> 00:48:09.849
I'm sorry.

00:48:12.372 --> 00:48:13.769
Please, come out.

00:48:59.314 --> 00:49:01.206
I think I should learn things on my own,

00:49:02.623 --> 00:49:06.152
whether it's pain or love.

00:49:08.243 --> 00:49:10.028
I don't have any memories
of those things anyway.

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:15.499
Who are you to decide
how I should live my life?

00:49:17.636 --> 00:49:19.340
And don't say it's because you care.

00:49:20.176 --> 00:49:22.775
You're just scared.

00:49:24.936 --> 00:49:25.617
Scared of what?

00:49:27.824 --> 00:49:29.128
You're scared that you'll love me.

00:49:30.372 --> 00:49:31.728
You're scared you'll get hurt.

00:49:33.889 --> 00:49:35.642
You're scared that one day I'll forget you.

00:49:38.197 --> 00:49:40.958
You act tough on the outside,

00:49:41.887 --> 00:49:43.583
but deep down, you're lonely as hell.

00:49:46.139 --> 00:49:51.272
You protect me because
it makes you feel valued—

00:49:52.294 --> 00:49:55.747
like someone in this world
actually needs you.

00:50:05.497 --> 00:50:10.000
You know me better than I know myself.

00:51:32.066 --> 00:51:33.160
Come on. Let's go home.

00:51:41.454 --> 00:51:42.701
I can't walk.

00:51:43.398 --> 00:51:44.113
Damn it,

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.487
I've been running around looking for you.

00:51:46.487 --> 00:51:47.647
I'm exhausted too.

00:51:48.762 --> 00:51:49.845
You said you liked me, didn't you?

00:51:51.146 --> 00:51:52.390
Then why don't you want to take care of me?

00:51:57.129 --> 00:51:59.398
Fine, I do.

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:05.507
Come here.

00:52:27.151 --> 00:52:28.540
Hey, that tickles!

00:52:30.073 --> 00:52:31.319
That tickles!

00:54:07.368 --> 00:54:08.636
What are you doing?

00:54:09.867 --> 00:54:10.816
Stay still.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:11.456
I didn't know that's how you eat an orange.

00:55:13.988 --> 00:55:17.668
You've still got a lot to learn being with me,

00:55:19.039 --> 00:55:20.844
Mr. Nava Mahasamut.

00:55:27.535 --> 00:55:28.898
Wait, what did you just call me?

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:32.430
Nava Mahasamut.

00:55:36.372 --> 00:55:38.487
You said you wanted a real name, right?

00:55:39.904 --> 00:55:42.484
I found one with a nice meaning.

00:55:45.783 --> 00:55:47.069
What does it mean?

00:55:51.065 --> 00:55:52.655
Nava means “boat.”

00:55:53.584 --> 00:55:55.932
Mahasamut means “ocean.”

00:55:56.373 --> 00:55:58.350
I wanted something related to water,

00:55:59.012 --> 00:56:04.344
and I think Nava suits your nickname.

00:56:05.157 --> 00:56:06.814
Plus…

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.099
Lava goes well with Nava.

00:56:12.863 --> 00:56:16.940
I like it. It fits me.

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:23.046
A boat floating in the ocean…

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:27.529
until one day it crashes onto an island
with a volcano.

00:56:27.812 --> 00:56:31.152
That's how Nava met Lava.

00:56:33.847 --> 00:56:35.433
You're thinking far ahead, huh?

00:56:36.372 --> 00:56:37.281
But fire and water?

00:56:37.281 --> 00:56:38.411
How can they ever coexist?

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:40.654
I don't know either.

00:56:42.094 --> 00:56:43.872
It's better to just let it happen naturally.

00:57:08.795 --> 00:57:09.885
NAVA MAHASAMUT.

00:57:49.623 --> 00:57:53.185
General, we've received a report
from our informant in Thailand.

00:57:53.673 --> 00:57:54.458
About what?

00:57:55.201 --> 00:57:57.058
About Prince Davin.

00:57:59.056 --> 00:58:00.166
Has a body been found?

00:58:00.372 --> 00:58:01.247
No.

00:58:01.642 --> 00:58:04.501
The prince is still alive.

00:58:11.633 --> 00:58:13.699
I knew Victor would fail this mission.

00:58:15.395 --> 00:58:17.102
Send someone to deal with this
as soon as possible.

00:58:17.474 --> 00:58:19.257
Send our best operative.

00:58:28.212 --> 00:58:29.875
I'm entering a boxing match.

00:58:31.269 --> 00:58:32.825
Why?

00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:34.506
To win back my dad's motorbike.

00:58:36.086 --> 00:58:38.996
I believe in you. You can do it.

00:58:39.275 --> 00:58:40.334
Do you have a vacant room?

00:58:40.822 --> 00:58:42.900
I was thinking of going to the beach nearby.

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.325
Should we take him there, Lava?

00:58:44.325 --> 00:58:46.932
You're too eager. He didn't even ask for help.

00:58:46.932 --> 00:58:47.935
Why would you take him there?

00:58:48.372 --> 00:58:50.299
Back off a bit. That's too close!

00:58:50.299 --> 00:58:51.959
That's the guy who pushed me!

00:58:54.166 --> 00:58:55.214
Uncle! Watch out!
