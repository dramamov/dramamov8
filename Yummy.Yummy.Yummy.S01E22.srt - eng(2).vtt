00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.800
Yangyang,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.040
today is your first day of school.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.430
You must study hard.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.380
(Victory)

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.270
So beautiful.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.880
Your auntie got up early

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.430
this morning to make it for you.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.710
It's called Victory Cake

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.120
for good luck.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.830
Your grandmother

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.480
scolded me again

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.800
just because I woke up a bit late.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.460
I said you could just have breakfast

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.410
on the way.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.550
Still,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.390
she kept scolding me.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.520
She thinks she can change her temper,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.750
but I don't think she can.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.760
Grandpa,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.710
don't you think everyone has changed

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.200
since we came to Yong'an?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.710
What do you mean?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.710
Dad has fans now.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.480
You've become a great chef.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.240
Auntie is more amazing than before.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.750
I can go to a good school.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.400
Only Grandma

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.400
seems to be the same as before.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.310
I don't even know what she likes.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.920
Do you know?

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.780
(Hongwen Academy)

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.640
We're here.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.480
Yes, we're here.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.240
Go in by yourself.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.830
- Okay.
- Take your lunch.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.550
Goodbye, Grandpa.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.870
Be careful.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.270
This child.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.820
(Hongwen Academy)

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.220
(Under renovation)

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.860
(Shen's Diner)

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.990
Come on.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.270
Everyone, have some water.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.270
You've been working hard.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.800
It's hard to expand the diner.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.590
Have some water before you continue.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.430
Come on, come on.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.330
Thanks, Mrs. Shen.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.480
You're welcome.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.240
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.120
Thanks a lot.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.960
Come on, take it.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.360
Take it easy.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.590
Fengxia.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.200
Catch this.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.920
Fengxia,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.870
Shen Jianshe, what are you doing?

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.480
What is this?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.750
This is called a carriage linchpin.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.920
It's for locking the carriage wheels.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.680
Just think of it as a car key.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.560
Listen.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.500
This is not an ordinary car key.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.120
This is the linchpin of the most stylish

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.360
and luxurious carriage in Yong'an.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.920
Shen Jianshe,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.280
you're too old

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.720
to stand so high.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.780
You can easily fall from there.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.060
Do you think you're Jackie Chan?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.580
What are you trying to do?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.580
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.220
Lately, I've been thinking a lot.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.300
I've realized

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.620
that our family

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.020
has changed.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.420
We're different from before.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.500
We've successfully entered

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.260
the upper class of Yong'an.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.460
Mr. Liu, owner of Guixiang Tavern,

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.860
invested in our diner

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.020
out of respect for me

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.340
and helped me buy the place

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.420
next door.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.420
With this expansion,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.700
we'll be able to live here.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.700
In short,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.160
everything is heading

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.780
in a good direction.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.020
The only exception is you.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.260
You haven't shared in my joy of success,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.700
so you're in a bad mood,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.860
you're upset,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.140
and I understand that.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.440
What are you trying to say?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.380
Back

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.620
in modern times,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.340
we were poor and had no money.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.900
You couldn't buy anything you wanted.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.300
You were miserable all day,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.820
working in the diner tiredly.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.780
But now, it's different.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.540
I just came back from the carriage shop.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.820
I've ordered a four-horse,

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.140
spacious, and luxurious carriage

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.140
as your personal vehicle.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.000
Also,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I'm officially announcing

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.040
that you don't have to work
in the diner anymore.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.270
I'll hire two helpers for you.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.180
I'll let them...

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.030
No.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.100
Not two helpers.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.020
Four helpers.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.220
You won't have to do anything.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.540
You just have to give orders.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.860
From now on, your job

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.820
is to sit in the carriage

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.900
I bought for you

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.540
and wander around Yong'an.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.860
Whenever you see something nice,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.500
just buy it.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.980
Silk, satin, brocade, jewels...

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.700
You can buy whatever you want.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.060
When you look at these things,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.460
your mood will improve.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.780
When your mood improves,

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.500
your temper won't be so bad.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.020
And if your temper isn't so bad,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.980
maybe you won't scold me anymore.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.820
Shen Jianshe,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.020
do you think my temper was bad

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.980
because you didn't make

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.340
enough money?

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.680
What else?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.140
- Mr. Shen, are you okay?
- Mr. Shen.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.300
It hurts.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.540
Why don't you help me up?

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.820
I've bought you such a big carriage,

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.780
and you can't even help me up?

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.660
Make yourself clear.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.140
Why do I have such a bad temper?

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.540
How can I know

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.580
why?

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.820
I've asked myself

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.100
over and over at night.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.740
You've always been like this.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.220
One wrong sentence,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.020
and your anger just flares up.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.140
When we were dating and got married,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.980
your temper was like this.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.420
It's still the same

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.580
even today.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.460
Apart from hitting,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.900
pinching, scolding, and kicking me,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.220
what else can you do?

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.260
Fengxia,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.420
I'm a man;

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.940
I have my dignity, too.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.500
I'm under huge pressure.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.020
Can't you show me some compassion?

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.980
Besides,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.180
I've succeeded.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.420
I have fans now.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.540
Why can't you give in to me a little?

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.500
Why can't you treat me better?

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.320
This is the most luxurious carriage

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.200
in all of Yong'an.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.420
Fengxia.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.700
(Hongwen Academy)

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.300
The sky is like a dome,

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.140
covering all directions.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.220
The earth is like a chessboard,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.060
round and boundless.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.500
Though the sky and earth
have different shapes,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.620
their patterns

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.540
are interconnected.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.900
The sky has the order
of the sun, moon, and stars;

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.540
the earth has the order of plants,
mountains, and rivers.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.820
Only when all things in the universe

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.820
follow this order

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.060
can they...

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.480
... can they coexist peacefully.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.740
You,

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.860
call her.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.180
Shen, Shen.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.340
Shen?

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.900
What did the mentor just say?

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.620
He said the sky is round
and the earth is square.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.100
The sky is like a dome.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.100
The sky is round; the earth is square?

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.380
That can't be right.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.100
How can the sky be round

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.740
and the earth be square?

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.300
We live on a planet, don't we?

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.740
The sky is the atmosphere;

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.540
the earth is what we stand on.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.580
Both the sky and the earth
are spherical.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.100
How can they be square?

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.180
What planet?

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.220
Atmosphere?

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.300
Nonsense.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.540
Shen,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.020
the sky is always round;

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.420
the earth is always square.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.620
Whether the sky

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.700
is round or square,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.940
you just haven't read enough books.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.340
Shen,

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.860
do you have any evidence

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.660
for such shocking statements?

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.460
Classmates,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.660
Mentor Zhao,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.180
have you ever raised a cat?

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.540
Cats love to push things to the ground.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.500
If the earth were square,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.980
then all the cats in the world

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.300
would have pushed everything

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.940
outside the earth by now.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.400
But the sky and the earth

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.700
are actually round.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.740
We live inside a sphere,

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.380
so the cats

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.860
haven't messed things up.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.460
It's the planet.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.340
Alright, alright.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.260
Be quiet.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.380
Shen,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.740
please sit.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.140
What did he mean?

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.260
If her father

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.100
hadn't pestered me,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.820
I would never have accepted Yangyang.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.180
Bringing in a girl

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.460
would only cause more trouble.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.500
But Mr. Shen

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.420
loves his daughter

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.180
so dearly,

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.380
and I truly admire that.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.220
That's why I agreed.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.820
But after all, she's just a child,

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.740
and she needs guidance from adults.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.300
Since her father is not here

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.540
today,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.740
I have to ask you

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.700
to come here.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.660
Yes, you're absolutely right.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.380
So, what did Yangyang do?

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.660
Speaking one's mind is a good thing,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.980
but in this world,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.900
many people get into trouble for that.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.420
Adults around her

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.060
must take responsibility

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.460
to prevent such trouble.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.580
I thought you asked me to come

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.060
because she'd caused some trouble.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.860
I also thought

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.140
you wanted my aunt to scold me.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.500
Yangyang is a promising girl,

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.020
nurtured by nature,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.180
full of wonderful ideas.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.660
If properly guided,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.920
she will surely achieve

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.220
great things in the future.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.060
Really?

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.660
You must be ambitious

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.580
and persistent in what you do.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.700
You're not the man I think you are.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.460
How so?

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.460
You're a natural educator,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.300
but to be a mentor at Hongwen Academy,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.220
where the Crown Prince studies,

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.900
you must be capable
of more than teaching.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.860
Understanding human relationships

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.300
is more important.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.500
In this world,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.540
things rarely go as one wishes.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.420
I often pray that my students

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.020
can be

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.020
the few lucky ones.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.140
Mentor Zhao,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.140
my family runs a diner,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.720
and we wish to express our gratitude
through a meal.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.420
Please do us the honor.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.300
No need to trouble you.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.620
As a mentor,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.180
guiding students is my duty.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.340
No trouble at all.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.580
Our diner is currently

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.940
under renovation and expansion

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.140
and is not open to customers.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.860
We truly want to invite you over.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.380
You can meet Yangyang's family,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.620
so you can guide us

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.380
on how to raise her in the future.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.980
In that case,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.940
I'll go.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.700
Thanks, Lady Shen.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.540
Thanks for honoring us
with your presence.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.500
Thanks, Mentor.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.900
(Yunshui Manor)

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.420
What kind of man is Zhao Xunzhi?

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.500
He betrayed his friends
for personal gain.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.660
You invited a wolf into the house

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.620
just for my sake?

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.420
I'm sorry,

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.500
but inviting Zhao Xunzhi over

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.240
for a meal is too risky.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.020
It's already done.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.220
The risk has been taken.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.140
Mr. Lin, don't waste

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.300
this opportunity.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.940
How can I ever repay you?

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.220
Mr. Lin,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.980
how can you say that?

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.820
You've helped us so many times before.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.180
Do we need to repay you for that?

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.060
Those don't count.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.860
Why not?

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.740
You've helped us so many times.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.060
Can we ever truly repay you?

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.600
This time is different.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.300
You're being righteous,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.160
but I...

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.380
You want to uncover the truth,

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.460
and we want to help you.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.260
Now, we have the perfect chance
to test him.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.100
Isn't that good?

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.540
If he has any issues,

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.520
it's better to find out

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.320
before it affects Yangyang.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.540
But I really like Mentor Zhao.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.580
Whatever I say, he never scolds me,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.940
and he always explains things to me.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.220
I'm starting to like going
to Hongwen Academy.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.340
Can such a good teacher

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.020
really be a bad person?

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.040
(Miss You in Yong'an)

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.800
(Shen's Diner)
Let's all raise our glasses

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.220
- to Mentor Zhao.
- To Mentor Zhao.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.280
- To Mentor Zhao.
- Okay?

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.240
Come on.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.580
All the words are

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.820
in this cup of wine.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.780
I'll toast you again.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.580
Mentor Zhao,

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.780
let me serve you some of this.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.310
- Thanks.
- Here.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.820
I'll toast you again.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.660
Alright.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.140
Cheers.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.140
Cheers.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.060
Mentor Zhao, here.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.980
I'll toast you, too.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.220
Thanks for taking care

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.180
of Yangyang.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.820
We're truly grateful.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.690
It's nothing, really.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.540
- To you.
- Good.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.340
Good.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.580
- Good drinker.
- Good.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.940
Good wine.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.540
Mentor Zhao, since my parents

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.460
have drunk to you,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.780
I have to follow suit.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.620
Here.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.740
Sure.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.300
No need to stand up.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.140
Sit, sit.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.820
Sit.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.260
Good.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.460
Good.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.660
What a great tolerance for alcohol.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.620
With you being Yangyang's mentor,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.660
we're at ease.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.340
- Right.
- I'll toast you again.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.860
Come on.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.280
I've just done
what any mentor should do.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.130
- Please.
- Cheers.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.000
- Come on.
- Cheers.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.500
Yangyang is so mischievous.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.260
You must've spent a lot of effort.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.580
You're so knowledgeable,

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.180
patient, and caring.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.300
We really don't know

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.700
- how to thank you.
- Yes.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.980
I'll toast you again.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.820
Sure.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.180
Thanks, thanks.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.020
Who is it?

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.940
Mr. Cui?

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.780
Mr. Lin,

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.060
your clothes resemble

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.500
Mr. Cui's.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.820
Mr. Cui?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.020
Who is he?

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.140
Is he an old friend

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.940
of yours?

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.860
Please sit.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.820
There is a story

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.900
I'd like

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.540
to ask you about.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.780
Alright.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.060
I'm all ears.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.180
Go ahead.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.900
Li Ji.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.660
Li Ji betrayed his friend

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.380
and has been condemned through the ages.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.720
It's a well-known fact.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.500
I wonder

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.460
what you are trying to ask.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.700
Have you ever done the same thing?

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.980
Who are you?

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.660
I'm the Vice Prefect,

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.540
speaking out for an old injustice.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.340
In the post-selling case

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.140
17 years ago,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.100
someone changed their testimony,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.540
leading to the conviction.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.540
I want to know

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.020
if his betrayal

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.820
of his friend

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.700
was out of his own wish

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.140
or someone's coercion.

(Spirit Tablet of Eldest Son Li Sheng)

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.660
Sheng,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.860
Anran is just like you.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.340
He's as smart and perceptive

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.100
as you were,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.200
which is why he was able

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.920
to uncover all this so fast.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.500
It was too fast

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.220
for me to bear.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:32.940
So,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.980
one day,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.580
I might have to send him

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.100
to join you.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.780
I'm sorry for him.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.020
Father, you should pay more attention

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.140
to the living.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.260
Lin Yan

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.500
has found Zhao Xunzhi.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.100
Zhao Xunzhi

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.780
values his reputation above all else.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.380
Once one misses a chance,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.340
there will be no turning back.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.020
What's done is done.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.220
He's serving me.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.580
He won't talk.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.740
What if he changes

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:37.860
his mind and decides

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.780
to serve someone else?

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.060
What if he's willing

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.660
to sacrifice himself

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.180
for his friend's only son?

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.220
What will you do?

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.300
Zhao Xunzhi

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.140
entered Shen's Diner

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.660
and hasn't returned home yet.

You can rest easy.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.140
I just feel

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.420
that it won't go so smoothly.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.980
Mr. Lin, bad news.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.820
Yangyang?

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.540
What's wrong?

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.140
Mentor Zhao didn't come
to class for no reason.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.340
He's disappeared.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.140
He's disappeared?

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.180
Young Master,

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.300
news from Vice Minister Cao:

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.340
Zhao Xunzhi

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.220
has submitted a document
in Nanming County,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.060
saying that he

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.020
is returning home for mourning.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.180
He just disappeared from Yong'an.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.540
It'd take at least three days
to get to Nanming.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.940
How could he have arrived now?

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.480
Zhao Xunzhi is already old;

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.260
his parents and elders
are no longer alive.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.400
Who is he going to mourn?

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.260
Prince Zhao?

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.140
Young Master,

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.820
you can't say that

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.660
for now.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.700
Go to Nanming County

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.700
and find Zhao Xunzhi.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.540
We must see him alive

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.030
or find his body.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.620
Yes.

that since this is so serious,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.610
we should just be ordinary friends

Auntie,

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.260

All these are foods
that can lift one's spirits.

Mr. Lin, my aunt
especially made these for you.

You've run into some trouble,

and you can't even eat?

to find Zhao Xunzhi,

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.700

We all understand how you feel,

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.600
but you can't just stay indoors

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.520
and refuse to eat.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.980
You've only been in this world

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.460

While you're investigating the truth,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.540
you also have to do your job
as the Vice Prefect.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.180
Can you stop being so hard on yourself?

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.700
I'm not

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.060
that depressed,

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.940
and I'm trying to find a way.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.780
Today, I was waiting for your food,

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.900
thinking you wouldn't come.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.180
So,

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.120
I just ate a little bit.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.780
I really can't eat any more.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.540
Grandma asked Auntie to bring the food,

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.420
but Auntie was hesitating at the door,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.860
unwilling to knock,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.340

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.020

It arrived last night.

Prince Zhao knows

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.460
that Yangyang has entered
Hongwen Academy.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.300
He says Zhao Xunzhi is upright

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.340
and can be a good mentor.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.420
He's pretending not to know

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.100
Zhao Xunzhi has disappeared,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.300
yet he writes a letter to test me.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.860
How hypocritical.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.140
What on earth does he want?

How is it going?

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.020
Zhao Xunzhi has never

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.340
shown his face
after returning to Nanming.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.300
He's never been married or had kids,

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.100
and he doesn't have any close family.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.500
Those clan members,

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.220
for some unknown reason,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.540
insist that he is staying at home,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.180
just unwilling to appear.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.740
I suspect

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.420
that he might have met

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.380
with some misfortune.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.340
Sure, let's just smash it

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.500
to vent our frustration,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.380
as if we're beating that bad old man.

Young Master,

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.100
why have you started, too?

Uncle Liu Chang, smash it.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.660
Me?

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.620
Crazy.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.580
You're crazy.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.660
All crazy.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.420
How satisfying.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.940
Isn't it really relieving?

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.200
Do you feel better now?

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.140
Much better.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:07.980
Don't worry.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.460
I'm not worried.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.980
Once your moment of anger passes,

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.180
there will always be a way.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.540
Mr. Lin,

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.260
you need to eat properly

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.420
and get enough sleep.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.180
As long as you are healthy,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.500
everything will get better.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.620
The Chinese New Year's Eve is coming.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.660
Uncle Liu,

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.500
why not join us for the celebration

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.500
at our diner?

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.940
Sure.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:39.300
That'd be great.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.700
In previous years,

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.420
it was just me and the young master,

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.020
which was really boring.

in the yamen,

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.180
eating steamed buns and pastries?

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.140
It's unbearable.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.300
I just...

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:56.980
Mr. Lin,

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.100
you have to go, too.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.460
Auntie,

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.500
haven't we prepared new clothes for him?

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:10.900

Auntie,

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.140
how could you say that about Mr. Lin?

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.100
I was too worried.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.560
How could I have thought

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.580
that you were like that?

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.940
You can never be like that.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.820
Forget it.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.380
I know what you mean.

Glad that you're not mad at me.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.940
I never could.

Mr. Lin, you have to go, too.

Auntie and I

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.420
have made new clothes for you.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.100

I'll pickle his name.

Thinking of it will make me sick.

Sir,

What is this?

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.720
- I'll tell you.
- A copper coin?

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.560
Yes.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.660
We'll put this copper coin

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.020
into one of the dumplings.

Yes.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.900
Jicai said she'd be back in five days.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.420
Why hasn't she returned?

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.540
I was thinking

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.060
that if she doesn't come back tomorrow,

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.860
I'll ask her father to go look for her.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.780
Yes.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.780
Where did she go?

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.140
I'll go look for her now.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.660
There's no need.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.820
Jicai must have a plan.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.220
She might come back tomorrow.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.900
Mother, add another filling.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.900
Look, she's back.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.300
- Lady Shen is back.
- You're back.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.460
You're back.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.140

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.140
So mysterious.

Let me see.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.460
Isn't this water shield from Qingyang?

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.980
You went to Qingyang?

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.780
I happened to pass by Qingyang.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.220
People in Qingyang eat dumplings

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.140

during the festival.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.740
We haven't had them for years.

There are still many outside.

Deyuan, help me out.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.100
Lady Shen,

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.740
did anyone else know

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.100
you went to Qingyang?

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.780
Were you stopped and questioned?

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.020
Did anyone suspicious follow you?

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.380
Don't worry.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.340
I was extremely careful.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.500
I went through mountains,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.860
and I didn't enter Qingyang at all.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.600
I picked them from a wild pond

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.340
at the border
between Qingyang and Shi'an.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.440
I didn't give myself away.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.500
That's good.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.740
Thank you so much

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.620
for going through so much trouble.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.540
Thanks, Lady Shen.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.740
Well.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.980
No need to thank her.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.980
It was on the way.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:01.980
It's nothing.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.860
Yes, yes.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.340
It's no trouble at all.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.780
But from what Lady Shen said,

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.060
it doesn't sound easy.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.100
I'll go get something else first.
