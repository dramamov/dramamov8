00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690
Princess Tianji sent a missive

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.540
saying that Mu Qibai had been incarcerated.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.100
It is a great thing,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.170
but I don't feel reassured.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.130
If there's a mastermind behind Mu Qibai,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.010
he won't live to see another day.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.100
Yet he still lives now.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.730
Perhaps he has a backup plan?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.850
Your Lordship,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.130
all the guards have been taken down.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.340
Please come with me.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.980
Ji Bozai has eliminated the netherbeasts.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.850
Lord Jingxi also died in Jixing Abyss.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.780
My Lord,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.170
what should we do now?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.980
Let it be.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.570
I never intend to work for Zhushui Spiritual State anyway.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.660
I just wanted to convince them

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.890
to entrust the task of raising netherbeasts to me

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.890
so that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.660
I can enact my own plan.

Shao Qun.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.450
You're my only confidant now.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.100
In this desperate time,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.170
we must raise another netherbeast as soon as possible.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.690
Rest assured, My Lord.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.690
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.290
I shall raise it with my soul and flesh.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.170
No one will find out.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.170
My Lord, your ambition will come to fruition.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.980
One last step now.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.340
Shao Qun.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.610
I didn't expect

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.700
today to come.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.290
My Lord, if you hadn't saved me,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.170
I would have been eaten alive by the hounds.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.490
It is my honor to die

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.980
for your legacy, My Lord.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.290
Shao Qun.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.050
When you're gone,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.290
no one will protect me like you do.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.490
Worry not, My Lord.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.660
I will always

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.810
protect you.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.900
Take care, My Lord.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.370
Something happened in the Sunken Abyss.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.460
It must be the netherbeast army.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.340
How come?

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.100
Didn't we eliminate all of them?

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.140
It's Mu Qibai.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.580
Mu Qibai somehow raised

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.610
new netherbeasts.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.540
It's too late to stop him now.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.100
So he does have a contingency plan.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.420
[Tianji: Mu Qibai fled with the help of the netherbeast army.]

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.290
Mu Qibai escaped with the netherbeast army,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.780
and he will be hiding.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.490
The Prayer Night is around the corner.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.580
The power of the stars will be at its strongest,

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.370
but so will

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.700
the power of the netherbeasts.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.460
That is the best moment

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.340
for Mu Qibai to invade Jixing Palace.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.730
I have a solution.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.810
Ming Xian once invented

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.340
a demon-repelling parasol.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.370
Yaoguang Mountain dislikes artifacts,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.780
so the Emperor of Yaoguang Mountain

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.980
destroyed it before he even inspected it.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.410
But I saw how he made it,

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.810
so I can replicate it.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.220
Are you serious about making the demon-repelling parasol?

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.300
Has it ever crossed your mind

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.300
that if someone from Jixing Palace

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.650
recognized your work,

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.850
your identity would be exposed?

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.650
The netherbeast army threatens all Six Realms.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.820
If we do not seal it,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.530
many more innocent people will die.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.530
Master also told us about the calamity

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.610
a century ago by the Spiritual Veins Fairy who raised netherbeasts.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.300
Have you forgotten?

But...

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.980
But what if they find out you're Ming Xian?

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.100
They will kill you

even if you save them.

But that hasn't happened.

The netherbeast army is the current threat.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.650
If I can help,

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.180
I mustn't stand by and do nothing.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.650

Why would I fall for it, though?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.610
It is inexcusable nonetheless.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.300
I wonder if Tianji will forgive me

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.580
once I give her this letter of repentance.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.010

where did he go?

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.770
His Majesty has made a full recovery.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.610
You have many ways to locate him.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.490
Why consult a physician like me?

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.700
Because you will indulge me,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.010
won't you?

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.940
Actually, I can also give you what Lord Hanfeng

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.730
You can't.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.340
Lord Hanfeng may not inherit Jixing Abyss,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.650
but it still needs a leader.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.460
Your Highness, do you still wish to marry Ji Bozai

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.610
so that he can run Jixing Abyss

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.220
as the prince consort?

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.890
Or,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.060
do you wish to run Jixing Abyss

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.890
as an empress?

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.370
Surprised?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.730
You did not hide your ambition well.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.650
You even doubt if you can make it.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.220
That's why you play it safe and look for a suitor

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.100
so that you can be the de facto leader

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.820

why not marry me

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.890
and let me run Jixing Abyss instead?

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.010

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.340
he is incapable of betraying you.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.370
Yan Xiao, you jerk!

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.980
Do you think everyone is like you?

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:57.850
I...

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.820
Tianji.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.940
I'm fine.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.370
I'm fine.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.650
Like this. Yes.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.580
- Thank you. - No worries.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.100
Take a parasol.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:32.850
Take a parasol.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.580
Thank you.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.980
Use it.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.980
- Take a parasol. - Thank you.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.850
You're welcome.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.850
- Come take your demon-repelling parasol. - Sure.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.530
Thank you.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.730
Take it.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.010
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.530
Here.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.610
Sure.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.650
Take a parasol.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.300
Thank you.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.010
You're welcome.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.700
Here. Take a parasol.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.250
Come.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:49.980
Thank you.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.340
- Thank you. - Take a parasol.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.650
I have some good tea inside.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.130
- Try it. - No, thanks.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.940
- We need to hand out the parasols. - Thank you.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.610
Come inside.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.220
All right.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.130
- Okay. - Here.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.820
Thank you.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.660
Great timing.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.140
Will you try the demon-repelling parasol for me?

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.980
The artisans crafted them using the blueprint

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.860
given by Ming Yi.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.010
Tianji.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.980
Is the parasol broken?

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.700
This parasol is amazing!

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.250
Spin it and its power will be activated

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.570
to create a defensive barrier.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.330
Meng Yangqiu.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.290
You'll have to train harder.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.180
Perhaps

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.140
you can learn from Chen Xi.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.530
Chen Xi.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.090
Teach me how to do it.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.730
Call me Master then.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.140
I'll buy you candies.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.490
Deal!

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.900
[Demon-repelling parasol blueprint]

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.460
Is this for Zhang Tai?

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.700
She just learned to use her spiritual veins.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.090
I want to make her an artifact that she can use.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.570
Did you design

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.940
that fan as well?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.860
The demon-repelling parasols

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.620
can protect the vulnerable ones.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.420
But to seal more netherbeasts,

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.770
we'll have to reinforce the power contained in the artifact.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.900
Once you're done,

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.770
I'll inject my power into it.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.770
Your master is already head over heels.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.180
Your master fell in love first.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.460
As if she doesn't know

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.980
she already has a fiancé.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.570
You...

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.620
Yes?

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.140
Your master did it first.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.290
Look at him.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.380
He developed feelings first.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.660
No, your master couldn't control herself.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.700
That's why they're stuck in this situation.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.330
She couldn't control herself?

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.620
Your master is way too shameless.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.460
That's why they are stuck.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.770
Stop it, you two.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:25.770
Actually,

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.490
I do have a request, Immortal Ji.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.700
The fan used by Ming Xian is called Embers.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.140
It is very powerful,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.900
and can be used to subdue netherbeasts.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.050
Embers?

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.900
So its name is Embers.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.290
What a great name.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.380
You want it back?

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.620
Can I?

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.530
Sure.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.010
But I destroyed it already.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.530
What?

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.910
Embers is my...

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.220
Ming Xian's most treasured artifact.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.530
Do you have any idea how many netherbeasts

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.490
it can defeat?

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.900
What does it have to do with me?

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.330
Ming Yi.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.900
We are spouses who share a heart imprint

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.810
and who had our names carved on the Marriage Stone.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.770
You're impossible.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.890
What did I say?

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.980
Look at your master.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.060
Look.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.300
Open your eyes.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.170
Are you upset now?

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.170
Granny Xun.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.980
Quick.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.810
Help him.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.170
Let me massage your dragon horns

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.460
- and save you. - Go away.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.940
Brush your cat whiskers instead.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:52.570
You sure you don't want

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.740
to see how smitten your master is?

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.700
Are you sure?

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.020
My master couldn't control herself, you said.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.850
We don't know what will happen

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.410
when we fight Mu Qibai,

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.540
but I will protect you.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.130
However,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.170
you must be prepared.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.810
If I survive,

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.410
you will not be able to escape from me.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.980
What if I say,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.850
instead of you protecting me,

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.610
why don't

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.370
we protect each other?

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.810
Xun Ming mentioned Heartbond Array in the Illusory Realm.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.540
Ancient tomes also said

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.780
that it could seal netherbeasts.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.700
During the netherbeast calamity a century ago,

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.780
it was the Heartbond Array that sealed them.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.610
To use the array, the spellcasters must be of one mind and one heart.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.330
If not,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.300
they will be caught in self-immolation.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.170
And it's precisely due to this high risk

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.020
that no one

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.330
has practiced it since then.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.650
If that's what we have to do,

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.330
then it's not that complicated.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.460
After all,

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:47.940
we are of the same mind.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.220
Aren't you in love

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.810
with my niece?

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.130
What's love

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.740
compared to power?

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.330
Princess Tianji is incapable of leading Jixing Abyss.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.980
Even if I side with her,

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.090
we will only become fodder

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.460
to the netherbeast army.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.260
After I ascend the throne,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.780
the position of Lord Hanfeng will be vacant.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.890
In my opinion,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.780
you are good enough to carry that title.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.410
I promise you

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.850
that you will be a non-relative vassal,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.650
the next Lord Hanfeng.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.460
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.300
No.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.810
At ease.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.130
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.410
Even though Tianji can wake her father up,

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.130
the divine enfeebling powder will still take effect.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.330
Your Majesty

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.980
can nonetheless accede legitimately.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.260
Now that my brother has taken enough enfeebling powder,

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.570
fighting him during the Prayer Night

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.740
is the best option.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.170
Then, we'll declare that Jixing Abyss has a new emperor.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.570
What do you think?

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.610
Wise choice, Your Majesty.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.170
Lord Chengyun, you were gravely injured in Jixing Abyss.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.170
Now that you have recovered slightly,

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.570
you came to my state in private.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.370
Your emperor might just hold you accountable for your actions here.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.740
I came

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.810
to negotiate with you, Your Majesty.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.090
Negotiate?

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.700
How arrogant.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.370
Your Majesty, surely you are aware

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.300
that Jixing Abyss is in turmoil lately.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.740
First, Your Majesty was misled

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.610
into underestimating

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.650
Ji Bozai's power in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.700
That already ruined your plan.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.060
Then, came Mu Qibai,

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:35.610
who sabotaged your years of effort in raising netherbeasts,

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.810
and even caused the death of Lord Jingxi.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.610
Jixing Abyss

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.540
is digging its own grave.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.060
I am offering my help

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.940
to get rid of Jixing Abyss.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.570
In exchange, I pray Your Majesty can aid me

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.850
in becoming the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.780
My son, Chao Yu, died in Jixing Abyss.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.980
Not only did Mu Qibai fail to disclose this to me,

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.410
but he even harbored the netherbeast core

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.170
in an attempt to go against me.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.130
I confer this important item to you.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.740
We'll see

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.940
if you can make good use of it.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.740
It is my honor

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.610
to serve you, Your Majesty.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.540
You will not be disappointed

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.020
for Jixing Abyss will be no more.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.850
The Prayer Night is upon Jixing Abyss.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.570
In these three long nights, all plants will wilt.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.330
After the Prayer Night,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.540
the cycle begins anew. Everything shall be reborn.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.060
The emperor uses his spiritual power as the foundation

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.060
to borrow the power of the stars before praying for all beings.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.060
May the benevolent stars strengthen our power.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.330
May the ones present

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.540
live a long life.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.410
May the light in Jixing Abyss shine for an eternity.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.060
I pray to you, the benevolent stars.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.330
I pray to you, the auspicious emperor.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:38.370
Excuse me.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.300
This one is good.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.640
- These ones are so pretty. - What about this one?

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.780
Let me see the one on your wrist.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.570
Check this out.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.020
It's so pretty.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.700
Let me see.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:49.940
I love the color.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.540
Look.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.170
What is happening?

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.020
What is this?

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.780
Blessings to all beings!

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.170
Ming Yi.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.130
Father,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.020
are you all right?

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.130
Surprised?

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.740
Yuanfeng, you held the Prayer Night

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.330
so that you can fool everyone

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.940
into thinking that Jixing Abyss is as prosperous as always.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.330
But you should know

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.890
that the superficial prosperity is meaningless.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.300
What Jixing Abyss needs is real power.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.940
Father!

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.410
Yuanfeng, you are poisoned.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.260
When you invoked your poisoned power to pray,

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.940
you incurred a great curse.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.410
Even the strongest warrior you have is powerless.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.820
Lord Hanfeng is revolting.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.290
Split into two teams.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.060
One team to protect the subjects of Jixing Abyss.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.940
One team to head to Jixing Palace with me.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:00.980
Noted.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.730
Yuanfeng,

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.130
sign on this Abdication Decree

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.770
with your blood

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.900
so that I can run Jixing Abyss.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.130
Then, I'll end everything.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:21.340
What do you say?

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.690
You will be relieved of your heavy burden.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.340
And I, as the only person in the Six Realms

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.130
who can command the netherbeasts,

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.020
will lead the netherbeast army

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.820
to conquer Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.060
Jixing Abyss will be one of the Upper Realms forever in the future.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.570
Resist no more, Yuanfeng.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.900
The divine enfeebling powder Yan Xiao gave you

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.170
is not an ordinary poison.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.170
I did not wish to do this.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.650
But your cowardice

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.650
and risk aversion

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.060
turned what was strong into weak.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.900
And the fitting ending for the weak

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.820
is death.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.540
[Abdication Decree]

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.060
You said you're doing this for Jixing Abyss,

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:36.340
but the first thing you do is to sacrifice our people.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.420
They are our subjects!

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.610
You will be feared momentarily,

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.980
and hated for life.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:47.860
Yuanfeng,

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.060
it doesn't seem like

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.540
we'll ever reach a consensus.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.060
Mu Qibai.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:19.770
Sorry for the long wait.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.650
Aren't you supposed to be...

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.540
Father, are you all right?

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.480
All of you are supposed to be poisoned.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.940
One must deliberately fall for the trap

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.290
before one can catch the ringleader.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.420
Mu Qibai asked me to add

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.770
the divine enfeebling powder to the emperor's medicine.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.650
His Majesty will have a damaged constitution within two weeks.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.610
And as His Majesty

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.250
uses his poisoned power to pray for everyone during the Prayer Night,

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.540
all beings

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.130
will be poisoned.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.770
Your decision to side with me seems final.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.540
I thought

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.460
it was just another part of your plan.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.900
Mu Qibai commands the netherbeast army.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.210
He is more likely to win.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.690
I did waver.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.690
But rest assured, Ji.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.650
I crave power,

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.730
but I do have a principle.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.540
I know

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.420
right from wrong.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.860
I'm curious.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.020
Why me, Yan?

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.500
Why not

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.460
work with your childhood friend, Princess Tianji?

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.060
Mu Qibai

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:00.290
might be more terrifying than we imagined.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.690
I must deceive Tianji too.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:06.540
Otherwise, I won't be able to earn Mu Qibai's trust.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.940
Ji,

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.380
if things

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.650
do not turn out the way we anticipated,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.900
please

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:14.860
do your best to protect Her Highness.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.060
I suppose

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.690
there's no running away from the poison

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.730
Mu Qibai instructed you to put in us.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:32.770
Uncle,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.290
give up already.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.170
Even if your plan works today,

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.940
your illegitimate coup d'état

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.610
will not convince everyone to follow you.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.570
Yuanfeng has been ill for a long time.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.090
His days are numbered

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.820
but there is no clear heir in sight.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.730
Jixing Abyss will have a leader.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.130
I will carry this burden

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.250
as long as I still live.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.570
I run the Shouhua Academy.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.290
I can make sure Jixing Abyss rises to the Upper Realms

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.540
without killing anyone.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.730
I won't let Jixing Abyss return

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.860
to the days when it had to kowtow to others.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.090
Preposterous.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.650
How naive of you to think

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.940
that faith alone can make

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.130
the other Five Realms submit to you.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.090
Her Highness has her way.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.060
She merely used faith

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.250
to tell you

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.090
that one must lead a realm with principles.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.340
Do not twist her words.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.540
Why? Do you think she should learn from you,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.940
who first colluded with Outer Realm,

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.860
and now relies on a wild and volatile power?

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.340
You will only meet your own demise.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.540
You know nothing.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.690
Don't lose it.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.540
