WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.377
What have you done to him?!

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.586
You want to see him?

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.921
Then come home, darling.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.923
You and your brother should die!

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.675
-You bitch!
-No, Mia!

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:10.468
You're not a monster.

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:11.511
Patrick.

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:14.973
Did I not tell you
to stay away from that boy?

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:16.141
Look what happened!

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:20.103
I would rather die than become like you.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.520
Ma'am Eden is evil.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.689
She's hurting Matmat's family.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:51.111
-P-Patpat!
-Patrick!

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.362
Patpat!

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.116
-Patrick.
-Patpat.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.367
Patpat.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.744
Patrick.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.704
Patpat.

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:05.208
Please wake up, Patpat.

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:10.046
-Patrick, please.
-Patpat.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.632
Wake up.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.385
-Patpat.
-Patrick.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.321
You're a great nurse,
but you're not a good person.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.407
"Good person."

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.201
Am I not a good person?

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.912
What kind of person wants
to have her own daughter killed?!

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.915
I'm not the only one
who wanted to do that.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.347
My only intention

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.934
was to get back at him for hurting Mia.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.729
You ruined the lives of many people,

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.940
including Samuel, Olivia, and Zelda!

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.109
Zelda?!

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.988
She's such an obedient…

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.531
fool.

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.627
I did everything for my daughter

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.005
just so she could
continue to be the best.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.050
That's how I show my love for her.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:45.350
I hope being in prison
teaches you what love means.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.268
Love?

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.937
Take her away.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.503
I'm so sorry.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.717
I'm so sorry.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.642
Patrick?

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.105
-How are you feeling?
-Mia.

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:34.816
Does anything hurt?

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.359
I'm okay.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.528
Where's Matmat?

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.280
Matmat's fine.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.073
He's with Vincent.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.494
You got hurt again,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.247
because of me.

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:54.210
I'm sorry.

00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:59.090
I'm so sorry.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.429
it's okay.

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:07.056
What's important is,

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.559
we found her.

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:15.106
We faced her together.

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.380
Mia.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.135
Are you coming back to me?

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.929
I'm just here to tell you

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.558
you'll pay for everything you did…

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.644
to Papa

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.898
and to Patrick's mother.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.566
Those people again?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.612
I'm your family, Mia.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:09.744
You're like a little demon
child who never stops eating,

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.707
unable to feel love for anyone else.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:19.462
Enough of that love bullshit.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:25.093
You won't be
the best because of that love.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.931
I used to hate butterflies

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.267
because they reminded me of you.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.535
But I guess
I shouldn't hate them after all

00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:54.122
because for other people…

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.333
…they have a deeper meaning.

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:00.461
Wow.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.546
Butterflies…

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.925
are for healing.

00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:08.261
Healing?

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.723
That's why…

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.186
I've sent you your own butterfly.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.245
Ma?

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.833
Uh…

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:40.543
Mama?

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:45.756
You're still my mother, right?

00:07:57.935 --> 00:07:59.228
Are you okay, Matmat?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.491
"Tessie G-Gonzales…"

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.535
"L-Loving…

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.163
m-mother of…

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:24.587
…Patpat and Matmat."

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:31.010
Matmat…

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:35.640
This is where we'll
visit Mama from now on.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.477
Hmm.

00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:44.524
C-Can I talk to Mama?

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.485
Of course.

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.368
Hi, Mama.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.080
Hello, Mama Tessie.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.876
M-Mama,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.212
I-I brought…

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:09.298
the book,

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.051
Mia wrote.

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:14.178
And then

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.931
M-Matmat…

00:09:22.186 --> 00:09:24.480
…d-did the drawings, Mama.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.321
T-The book has…

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.449
Matmat's name on it.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.578
It's written on it, Mama.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.963
I-I wish you were here, Mama…

00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:54.510
…t-to see Matmat's work.

00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:00.433
You'd be proud of M-Matmat.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.979
You'd be proud of Matmat.

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.255
I'm sure Mama's so proud of you.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.549
Mmm?

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.301
She's happy for you.

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:53.527
I will take care of
our family, Mama Tessie.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:58.991
Mama…

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:04.497
We've finally gotten
justice to your death.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.630
Matmat and I can heal now.

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.136
Our family will be at peace.

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:30.606
Just wait for it.

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.149
Are you guys ready?

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.318
-R-Ready!
-Okay.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.570
Open sesame!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.906
Ta-da!

00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:42.410
Wow! Wow! Wow!

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:44.620
I-It's a camping car!

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:50.292
Consider this my
payment for your painting.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.879
This is M-Matmat's camping car?

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.714
Oh! Not really.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.007
It's just for rent.

00:11:57.091 --> 00:12:00.094
Tell me how long you'll use it,
and I'll rent it for you.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.515
C-Can Matmat g-go in?

00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:06.851
Of course! Come, let's go in.

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:09.270
Wow!

00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:11.230
-Can you believe it?
-Wow, this sure is heavy.

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.149
Come.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.525
-Wow!
-Get in.

00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:17.319
This rascal's thoughtful after all.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.615
Mama Li,
we've got something for you, too.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.534
-For me?
-Mm-hmm.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.496
-Wow! Can I keep this?
-Yes.

00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:30.040
Wow!

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:34.295
The illustrator even
wrote you a special note.

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:35.379
Oh?

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.007
"M-Mama Li,

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:43.596
you are Matmat and Patpat's second mom.

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:46.724
Thank you for everything".

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.897
He called me his second mom.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.901
Mama…

00:12:57.651 --> 00:13:00.070
You really are our second mom now.

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.407
Thank you.

00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:06.577
Thanks. You know…

00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:09.079
among all my adopted children,

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.541
you three are my favorites.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.418
Don't you tell Jason that.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.047
-Hmm.
-Patpat.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.758
Mia and Patpat,

00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:23.427
l-let's go on a camping trip.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.179
Sure, Matmat.

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:31.101
L-Love you, Ma! Bye-bye!

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:35.022
-Bye-bye!
-I love you!

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:41.654
-Ma?
-Stop!

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:45.115
-Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
-Love you, my children!

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:48.744

Alright. I'll go set up.

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:39.920
Matmat and I will help you.

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.213
Really? Come on.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.423
-Wow!
-Let's go.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.719
Let's take a picture.

Game, game.

00:14:48.762 --> 00:14:49.763
You take it.

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.307
-Give me the phone.
-Mm-hmm.

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:54.101

00:14:55.936 --> 00:14:57.563

One, two, three…

Mia!

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.845
Did you have a good time?

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:17.267
I'm so glad you two brought me along.

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.854
I know it was
supposed to be just the two of you.

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.941
Hey, you're our family.

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.567
Of course you should be here.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.240
Thank you for coming.

00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:37.621
No matter where that camper van goes,

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:39.206
I'll be there.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.127
We should go before it gets dark.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.503
Let's go.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.217
Matmat!

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.301
Come on!

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:02.312
Matmat, why do you have your bag?

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:04.356
We're going out to see the waterfalls.

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:09.611
Matmat…

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:14.783
Matmat is not
coming to see the waterfalls.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.035
Huh?

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.286
Why? Are you okay?

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:23.500
T-Today is M-Matmat's,

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.586
first day of work.

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:27.337
Is that today?

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.006
We should head back to Maravida then!

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.426
No, Patpat.

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:35.054
Only Matmat has work,

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:40.059
so Matmat's the only one leaving.

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:45.272
Matmat, we're all going
back to Maravida together.

00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:46.440
Come on.

00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:48.942
Let's go to our next destination first.

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:53.113
M-Mia.

00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:56.283
Only Matmat will leave.

00:17:57.659 --> 00:17:58.869
But Matmat…

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:18.055
Patpat…

00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:23.352
E-Enjoy the rest of your vacation.

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:29.274
Patpat worked all the time for us,

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:33.028
now it's Matmat's turn.

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.493
You'll be okay, Matmat?

00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:40.702
I won't be there.

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:46.792
Matmat will… be alright on his own.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.004
Matmat will be okay.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:52.172
Now…

00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:58.846
P-Patpat can finally do what he wants.

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:11.066
Don't… Don't be sad.

00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:16.697
Don't cry.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.117
M-Matmat is still your big brother.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:28.292
M-Matmat will send
you money when he gets paid.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.805
H-Happy day!

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.274
Happy day!

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.613
Happy day, Matmat.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:10.167
Happy day.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.502
Happy day…

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.095
Don't cry.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:25.974
Don't cry! Don't cry!

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.775
Bye-bye!

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.735
Bye-bye!

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:56.964
Bye-bye!

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.358
Bye-bye!

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:18.568
Bye-bye!

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.362
B-Bye-bye!

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:40.841
And then,
the evil Shadow Witch appeared.

00:21:41.508 --> 00:21:46.054
She forcefully took
Mask Boy and Princess Wapa

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:53.520
and said "You two will
never see your happy faces again!"

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:58.442
The Shadow Witch
took them to a small and dark cave

00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:01.862
and hid Mask Boy and Princess Wapa.

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:04.865
A few days later,

00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:07.617
Mister Box found the cave.

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:09.661
But he couldn't get in

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:11.455
because the opening was too small.

00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:14.374
"I-I need to…

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:20.213
remove the box
on my head so I can fit in."

00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:23.133
The Mask Boy heard Mister Box's voice.

00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:24.593
"Mister Box!

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.470
Don't worry about us.

00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:28.013
Save yourself.

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:30.265
The Shadow Witch
will be back any minute."

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:33.310
But Mister Box mustered his courage

00:22:33.393 --> 00:22:35.395
and removed the box on his head.

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:37.314
He went inside the cave

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:41.651
to save Mask Boy and Princess Wapa.

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:44.613
Once they escaped
the small and dark cave,

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:47.824
Mask Boy and Princess Wapa saw

00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:51.495
Mister Box's dirty face.

00:22:51.578 --> 00:22:53.580
They burst into laughter.

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:58.668
"I finally see your face, Mister Box!"

00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.754
Princess Wapa said.

00:23:00.837 --> 00:23:03.256
But they didn't stop laughing.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.801
Then, Mask Boy's mask fell,

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:09.221
along with the can
on Princess Wapa's body.

00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:11.681
It made a loud
sound as it fell to the ground.

00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:13.391
With the box no longer covering his face,

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:16.103
Mister Box finally saw the faces

00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:18.897
of Mask Boy and Princess Wapa.

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.192
I like her.

00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:30.325
Patpat is…

00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:32.953
…happy?

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.083
"I can finally see your faces!"

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:40.961
He laughed and said…

00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:44.464
P-Patpat is happy.

00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:47.717
So is Matmat.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.723
The Shadow Witch
didn't steal the happy faces

00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:58.103
of the Mister Box,
Mask Boy, and Princess Wapa.

00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:03.567
The courage to seek happiness

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.861
that they once lost.

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:10.115
Now carried with them on a new journey.

00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:33.471
Hello, Matmat.

00:24:34.097 --> 00:24:36.016
Hello, Patpat.

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.977
Are you done with school?

00:24:39.686 --> 00:24:42.022
Yes, Matmat.
My classes are finished.

00:24:43.523 --> 00:24:44.774
O-Okay.

00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:48.653
Did you get the allowance I sent you?

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:51.406
F-Five thousand pesos.

00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:54.326
Yes, Matmat. I got it.

00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:56.661
But you don't need to send more.

00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:59.164
I already have
part-time work here at school.

00:24:59.247 --> 00:25:03.001
Don't hustle at school anymore.

00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:07.756
Matmat will keep sending
money so you can finish quickly.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:11.218
So you can become a nurse right away.

00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:12.302
Okay?

00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:15.513
Just tell me whenever

00:25:15.597 --> 00:25:17.015
you need anything, alright?

00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:20.268
Take care on your way home.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.979
Tell Mia to take care too.

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:27.234
And tell her not to be
stubborn or mischievous.

00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:30.528
Okay, Matmat. I'll tell Mia.

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:31.780
Okay.

00:25:32.322 --> 00:25:34.366
-Take care, bye.
-Bye-bye!

00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:42.666
H-Happy day!

00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:44.626
-Happy day!
-Happy day!

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.767
Overall, this past month,

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.686
I think I've been doing pretty well.

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.063
How about your temper?

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.275
Well…

00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:11.111
Aside from one of
Patrick's classmates I want to kill

00:26:11.194 --> 00:26:12.862
because she keeps texting him,

00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:15.865
I think I've been doing pretty well.

00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:18.285
Mia…

00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:21.830
Besides, Doc…

00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:25.959
It's okay to not be okay.

00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:29.504
Yes, it's okay.

00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:32.382
It's okay.

00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:37.053
So, Mia? See you next month?

00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:38.513
See you next month.

00:26:39.806 --> 00:26:40.974
-See you.
-Thank you.

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:16.801
I knew I'd find you here.

00:27:20.597 --> 00:27:23.808
How's that over-friendly
girl in your school?

00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:27.645
Mia, I already told you,
she's just my classmate.

00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:30.607
You have nothing to worry about.

00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:37.072
This is for you.

00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:47.957
I've become so predictable.

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:52.796
Alright, let's just eat.
What do you want to eat?

00:27:54.589 --> 00:27:56.508
-Tomato and eggs.
-Tomato and eggs.

00:27:56.591 --> 00:27:58.343
Again?

00:27:58.968 --> 00:28:00.553
You're not tired of it yet?

00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:03.056
I love it.

00:28:05.308 --> 00:28:07.268
It never gets old.

00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:09.687
Like this.

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:27.914
I love you, Mia.

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:30.917
I love you.

00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.009
M-Mia?

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:43.471
Mia, I love you.

00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:45.932
Mia, I said I love you.

00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:48.309
I love you, Mia!

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.562
I love you, Mia!

00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:52.397
I said I love you!

00:28:58.862 --> 00:29:00.155
I love you too,

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:02.532
my safety pin.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.638
It's Okay to Not Be Okay!
