(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

=Episode 7=

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:55.600
The interrogation was halfway through.
And you wanted to leave him hanging.

00:01:55.622 --> 00:01:56.620
Now, great.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.130
He leaves us hanging instead.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.820
Strategy?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.540
I don't see
your strategy doing any good.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.660
Why are you

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.210
so impatient?

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.260
If you're so impatient,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.500
how can you be a criminal investigator?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.688
Fan Jiancheng is so cunning.

00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:10.933
How can I not be anxious?

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.500
You really aren't worried.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.380
Your work attitude right now
is a problem.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.540
Have you already decided
that Fan Jiancheng

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.780
is the criminal?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.410
Listen.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.500
This is a major taboo for us police.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.820
Before the verdict comes out,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.940
he's just a suspect.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.260
Do you get that?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.540
Who are you to judge?

00:02:34.644 --> 00:02:35.729
If you keep this up,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.488
you might as well
quit criminal investigation.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.220
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.660
Weren't you also reprimanded

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.220
for showing the photos and videos

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.290
to Qin Nan?

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.780
Is...

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.410
Is that the same?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.260
Back then,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500
I was completely unaware
and acting in a personal capacity.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.940
I think you have a point.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.890
I was wrong.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.820
I was just too anxious.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.260
If you're really anxious,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.340
don't argue over his statement.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.940
Keep looking for new evidence.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.410
Why can't the testimonies

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.100
about Ye Sibei being drunk

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.100
be used as evidence?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.430
The testimonies show

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.500
she wasn't sober that night.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.410
So Fan Jiancheng's claim

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.500
that Ye Sibei seduced him
doesn't hold up.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.380
Being drunk

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.000
itself is a very weak piece of evidence.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.890
Think about it. Someone drinking.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.550
Their

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.740
mood, environment,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.730
and the way they drink

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.170
matter a lot.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.100
You're right.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.340
Chuchu mentioned before

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.940
that Ye Sibei was upset that night.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.820
How about this?

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.340
Call Ye Sibei here again.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.500
We'll take another statement.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.500
Okay.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.020
(Police)

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.340
Do you and Fan Jiancheng
have any contact

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.340
outside of work?

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.500
No.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.810
We never chatted privately.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.580
We only talked about work.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.490
In public occasions,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.980
he showed care for my life

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.340
like an elder.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.710
I respect him a lot.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.610
I'm also grateful.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.410
Grateful?

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.740
Why do you feel grateful?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.490
Because I couldn't find work.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.140
Fuqiang didn't plan to hire me at first.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.810
It was Fan Jiancheng
who told HR to keep me.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.220
So I'm very grateful.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.490
Why did Fan Jiancheng ask HR

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.340
to let you join the company?

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.220
He said I was a college student

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.660
and capable.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.490
If I were rejected due to age,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.810
it'd be a pity.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.850
But whether that reason was true,

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.100
I don't know.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.610
Are you short of money lately?

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.780
Yes.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.610
My brother is getting married
and buying a house.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.780
I took a credit loan of 100,000 yuan.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.050
I asked Fan Jiancheng
for proof of employment.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.930
I wanted my salary written higher

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.100
for easier loan approval.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.340
And did he give it to you?

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.220
Yes, he did.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.340
He always acted friendly in the company,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.100
so he would help with that.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.370
Did you call Fan Jiancheng
after the incident?

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.490
I made one call.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.290
I needed to ask for leave.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.610
Before that...

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.100
Given your tolerance,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.488
how much can you usually drink?

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.980
I'm not sure.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.490
Because I rarely drink.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.100
I had never really gotten drunk before.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.340
But you did drink before.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.930
What's the most you've had at once?

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.930
53% baijiu

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.660
served in tiny glasses...

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.810
Around 13 glasses.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.460
That's impressive.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.850
When you say
you've never been truly drunk,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.730
what did it feel like?

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.170
Just a bit dizzy,

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.980
feeling excited,

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.250
wanting to talk,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.850
but still fully aware.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.580
At most, walking would sway a bit.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.170
So your consciousness was clear?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.300
Sibei.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.050
I asked a friend.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.980
The water plant where he works
is short of a bookkeeper.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.220
But the pay is a bit low.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.610
I've already spoken to him.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.730
Do you want to check it out?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.730
No problem.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.930
I'll tell him.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.300
Done.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.460
After breakfast,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.250
you can pack up and go.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.170
Okay.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.250
I also sent
the contact info and address on WeChat.

00:07:10.977 --> 00:07:12.466
Good luck with the interview.

(Nancheng Fengze Water Plant)

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.420
Sibei.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.150
Hello.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.010
Hello.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.340
I'm Nan's childhood friend.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.370
Just call me Dachun.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.370
He told me about you.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.340
I'll show you inside.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.220
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.720
(Visitor Entry Guidelines)

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.850
This is our water plant.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.850
Sibei, over here.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.220
Director.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.730
Sibei.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.250
Dachun, I have urgent matters.
I'll head out first. We'll talk later.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.250
No, Director.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.340
I'll only take a few minutes.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.810
I mentioned to you before.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.580
This is my friend's wife.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.340
A college graduate.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.644
She was previously an accountant
at a real estate company.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.370
Hello, Director.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.460
Here's my resume.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.170
28 years old, married,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.050
no children.

00:08:15.022 --> 00:08:16.711
Where were you an accountant before?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.050
Fuqiang Real Estate.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.570
Fuqiang...

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.810
Has something happened

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.850
at your company recently?

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.660
Seems like

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.490
a girl went out drinking and got raped.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.980
What's her name?

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.820
Her name is...

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.060
(Ye Sibei, Resume)

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.470
Director.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.000
It has nothing to do with her.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.220
Dachun, I'm feeling unwell.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.250
I'll leave first.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.040
Thank you.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.980
Sorry to trouble you.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.820
Si...

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.340
Sibei.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.180
Dachun.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.100
How could you bring someone in

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.100
without checking first?

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.780
I...

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.210
I'm leaving.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:38.060
(Nancheng Fengze Water Plant)

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.370
Sorry about earlier, Dachun.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.610
It's okay.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.940
Don't worry about it.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.460
This...

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.340
Thank you.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.700
I'll head back now.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.180
Sorry to trouble you.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.300
I heard a bit about what happened.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.980
I'm an outsider. I shouldn't say much.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.370
But Nan and I grew up together.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.390
I know him.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.610
He's kind-hearted.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.130
If you two can stay together,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.850
treat him well.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.660
That's all.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.530
It isn't like
what people are saying out there.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.530
I understand.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.940
If you have any difficulties,
let me know.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.420
I'll be going now.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.610
Mechanic.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.450
Is anyone here?

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.820
Hurry.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.130
Bro, again?

00:10:45.422 --> 00:10:47.244
- What happened?
- Again. A tire's flat again.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.370
I remember I just fixed it.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.180
It got punctured again?

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.490
Yes, it's flat again.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.420
Bro, let me see where it's punctured.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.300
Here.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.530
Where?

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.490
Here. Look.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.100
Right in the center.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.880
Isn't this
the one you patched last time?

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.780
No.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.180
I remember last time I patched

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.088
a bit more to the side.

00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:14.222
This time, it's dead center.

00:11:14.222 --> 00:11:15.022
Look.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.940
Don't try to cheat me.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.650
This is the hole from last time.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.490
If it wasn't patched properly, fine.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.940
Why are you arguing with me?

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.250
It's obviously not the same.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.650
This is a fresh one.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.000
I'm the boss here.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.450
What's going on?

00:11:27.577 --> 00:11:28.969
Look at his skills.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.911
It's only been a few days
since he patched the tire,

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.755
and it's already bad?

00:11:31.755 --> 00:11:34.080
- Speak properly. I didn't patch it wrong, okay?
- How am I supposed to speak properly?

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.940
What's going on?

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.420
He came by a few days ago to patch it.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.650
I remember it wasn't in the center.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.844
It was a bit to the side.

00:11:41.866 --> 00:11:43.730
Look,
it's right in the middle this time.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.280
Dead center.

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:46.540
He insists
I didn't do a good job last time.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.530
Do you think
two nails can make one hole?

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.850
I can't handle this?

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.390
It's fine.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.330
Sorry.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.300
We might need to inspect this tire.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.490
Sure, go ahead.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.660
Give us a moment.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.220
Take a look.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.940
This is where it was patched last time.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.820
And this is the new puncture.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.660
So?

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.420
Since it's a new puncture,

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.650
it can't be free.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.720
But today I can give you 20% off.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.450
Deal?

00:12:52.088 --> 00:12:53.130
But I want you to patch it.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.820
I don't want that laborer.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.300
Go grab a meal first.

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:00.377
Come back in half an hour to pick it up.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.850
Fix it quickly.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.060
Let's go.

00:13:10.177 --> 00:13:11.940
They clearly came looking for trouble.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.330
Honestly,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.100
I really wanted to hit him.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.060
Forget it.
We're in the service industry.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.530
Hi, Sibei.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.220
Nan's inside.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.100
Okay.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.420
I'm back.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.100
You're back.

00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:48.250
How was the interview this morning?

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.180
It was okay.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.370
Are you tired?

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.820
Look at that woman.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.490
Is she
the one from our chat group last night?

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.330
Seems familiar.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.850
Why are you so jumpy?

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.260
The car's fixed.

00:14:07.288 --> 00:14:08.370
Drive it away and get lost.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.900
What did you say?

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.610
Can't you understand Chinese?

00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:14.900
I told you to get lost.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.420
Seriously?

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.250
These darn mechanics
are driving me crazy.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.060
I'm not leaving.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.980
I'm back again.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:24.980
I still won't leave.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.530
What can you do?

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.980
Qin Nan.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.530
Nan.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:30.370
Get lost!

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.300
Are you okay?

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.650
You want to fight?

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.940
I'm speechless.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.250
I'm just fixing a car, and this happens.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.780
You want to hit me?

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.100
Come on, hit me here.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:47.850
Hit me here, got it?

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:49.850
What?

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.690
Scared?

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.820
Come on, hit me here.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.820
Hit me here. Go.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.060
Bro, forget it.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.060
- Let's go.
- Qin Nan.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.850
Alright.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.010
We've got other things to do.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.610
- Let's go.
- Just you wait.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.100
Just wait!

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.650
Look at these lowlifes.

00:15:13.133 --> 00:15:15.100
Don't take what they said
to heart, Sibei.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.630
Enough, go inside with Sibei.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.690
Go back.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.550
Don't take what they said

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.350
to heart.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.300
No matter what they say,

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.250
don't overthink it.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.850
If someone says stuff like that again,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.940
just cover your ears.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.820
Once we finish the lawsuit,

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.220
we'll leave this place.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.220
Don't be so impulsive anymore.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.060
People like that aren't worth it.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.860
Nan, Sibei.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.960
Food's here.

00:16:12.355 --> 00:16:13.250
Let me do it.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.100
It's alright.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.130
Here you go.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.610
How was the interview today?

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.100
They said I'm not a good fit.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.020
It's okay.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.490
I'll ask other friends.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.300
If it doesn't work out,

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.530
you can help out at my shop.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.530
Why do you have so many books here?

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.300
Sibei, listen to me.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.980
Nan sometimes speaks all fancy

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.650
because he reads too much.

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:06.810
Don't listen to his nonsense.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.980
Sometimes I just read

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.977
when bored fixing cars.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.220
Why didn't you read at home?

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.200
Reading
in front of a college student like you?

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.250
I worry you think I'm pretending.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.220
Nan is a cultured man.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.220
You don't know Nan

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.250
well enough.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.660
You'll have plenty of time
to learn about him.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.500
Eat your meal.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.660
Hello?

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.530
Sibei.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.530
Management has stepped in.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:58.940
Come by the office when you have time.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.980
They'll give you an explanation
about this matter.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.500
Got it.

said they want to talk to me.

Sibei.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.180
I don't think you should go.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.250
It's clearly a trap
waiting for you to fall in.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.140
Nan, what do you think?

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:22.940
What do you think?

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.700
I'm going.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.570
They said
they'll give me an explanation.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.330
I want to see what they have to say.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.500
Alright.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.140
I always rode this
before we got married.

After getting married,

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.490
I worry that you think it's dangerous.

for a ride on it.

Sibei, you're here.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.180
Let me introduce you.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.700
This is Mr. Zhao.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.650
You've met him before.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:07.700
And this is...

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.620
Sibei, why don't we sit first?

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.888
We'll talk after sitting.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.700
Please sit.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.850
Sibei.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.010
Sorry.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.180
You even had to come all the way here.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.050
Mr. Zhao

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.460
values you highly.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.490
So today,

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.050
we still want to talk about Mr. Fan.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.220
Here's 200,000 yuan.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.490
Enough to clear your loan

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.490
and save a bit more.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.540
Ye Sibei.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.620
If you have any requests, just tell us.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.420
The company will help.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.140
Is this your compensation?

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.050
You can take it however you like.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.530
But once you take the money,

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.860
just explain things clearly.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.730
That's fine, right?

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.420
Explain what?

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.940
Don't play dumb.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.220
You accused Mr. Fan.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.180
That hurt the company's reputation.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.250
You know that, right?

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.700
We could've sued you.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.770
But Mr. Zhao
was generous and wanted peace,

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:48.900
so he called you here.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.940
You just want money, right?

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.180
Now you've got it.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.730
We can call it even.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.940
Is that what Fan Jiancheng told you?

00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.940
He said I wanted money?

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.050
If you're not happy with this amount,

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:06.420
we can discuss it.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.260
Discuss what?

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.220
You think I framed him?

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.380
Sibei.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.420
I know you well.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.220
It can't be a false charge.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.900
There must be a misunderstanding

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.180
between you and Mr. Fan.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.050
What misunderstanding?

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.490
I didn't arrest him.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.490
The police did.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.490
What misunderstanding?

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.620
Tell the police that.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.140
Ye Sibei.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.220
Stop pretending.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.900
This is Mr. Fan's wife.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.740
Zhao Shuhui.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.010
You just think the money's not enough.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.050
If it's not for money,

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.220
why are you here?

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.220
Why am I here?

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.460
I came to ask

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.420
what Fuqiang Real Estate

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.700
plans to deal with that scumbag
Fan Jiancheng?

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.490
Who are you calling a scumbag?

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.380
- Who are you calling a scumbag?
- Shuhui.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.220
- Shuhui.
- Say it again if you dare! Say it again!

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.250
Shuhui, don't be angry.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:47.660
Well...

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.020
Why don't you take a short break?

00:24:49.022 --> 00:24:49.822
Leave this to me.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:55.940
Mr. Zhao.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.620
Maybe let us talk alone.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.540
Okay.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.780
(Money)

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:32.890
Sibei.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.090
Sibei.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.050
Now it's just the two of us.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.730
Listen to me.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.460
I'm helping you.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.530
The company doesn't know what happened,

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.050
so it can't just

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.620
take action against Mr. Fan

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.490
without knowing the truth.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:56.420
They can't punish him,

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.460
but they can pay me

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.490
to make me retract?

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.140
You can't say it like that.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.660
It's not retracting.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.010
I just hope you'll tell the truth.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.250
Every word I've said

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.620
is the truth.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.220
Fine.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.940
You can ignore the company's name

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.460
and your own reputation,

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.340
but you still need to make a living.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.620
Have you found a job?

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:29.620
If you had found one,

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.380
you wouldn't be sitting here.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.940
Think about it.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.430
A woman
who drinks with clients at night,

00:26:37.444 --> 00:26:39.022
needs her superior to drive her home,

00:26:39.044 --> 00:26:40.700
and owes a huge amount of debt.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.530
And a superior
who has a happy family, upright,

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.220
rich and influential.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.490
Who would believe it's rape?

00:26:50.022 --> 00:26:51.380
What superior wouldn't think twice

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.530
before hiring you?

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.050
What if you do it again?

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.090
Sibei.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.010
Your only way out now is to be honest,

00:26:59.010 --> 00:26:59.730
apologize,

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.380
and return to Fuqiang.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.380
Do you understand?

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.660
I don't have to stay in Nancheng.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:07.940
I can leave.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.020
Yes.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.260
You can leave.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.660
But what about your family?

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.530
You'd have your husband
give up his shop,

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:19.730
give up his home,

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.530
make Chuchu lose her job,

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.050
make your parents suffer shame,

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.220
have your brother lose his future,

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.660
and move the whole family away?

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.940
Aren't you being selfish?

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.460
Sibei.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.810
Sometimes in life,

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.460
you must bow your head
and take shortcuts.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:57.770
Take the money,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.660
and everyone will be happy.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.010
If you don't take it,

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.490
you'll hurt yourself and others.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.380
It truly is a shortcut.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.010
That's the right choice.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:36.700
But I can't do it.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.220
I can't accept this injustice.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.620
I can't watch someone
who should be punished

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.290
live freely in this world,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.180
doing as he pleases,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.660
while I live in pain.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.460
Have you really thought this through?

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.460
This path is hard.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.300
I know.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.940
But someone must walk it.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.530
You can threaten me,

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.220
but I'll tell you this.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.490
If you fire Chuchu,

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.860
this won't end well.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.660
I'll go online.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.050
I'll tell everyone what I know.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.700
You think this is the worst outcome?

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.540
It's not.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.380
Ye Sibei, are you insane?

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.380
You think posting it online
will draw attention?

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.570
People will curse you

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:15.700
for making it public!

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:16.540
We'll see!

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.460
I'll post the recording online.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.940
I'll tell everyone

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.180
how you tried to make a victim retract.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.730
I'll clearly tell the world who you are,

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:31.530
what you look like,

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:32.490
and what you've done.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.620
Tao Jie, you'd better pray

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.180
none of you ever make a mistake.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.010
Or you'll face judgment

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.490
from the world with me!

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.700
Ye Sibei.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.940
You're a lunatic!

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.220
Stop threatening me.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.420
Stop trying to stop me.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.620
I'll press this case.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.860
As long as I live,

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.180
I'll never give up.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.010
I'll fight for what's right.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.700
I'll demand justice!

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.380
I'll tell you this.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.010
In this world,

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.420
truth and justice still exist.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.780
And I

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:09.940
will get them.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:23.570
Sibei.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.180
I lost my temper, okay?

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.730
Calm down.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.620
We can

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.660
talk this through.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.220
Give me your phone.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.060
Give it to me!

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:35.570
Stop her!

00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:36.290
What happened?

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:36.860
Get her!

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.620
Don't let her leave!

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.900
Don't let her get away!

00:30:38.911 --> 00:30:40.090
Don't let her leave!

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.900
- Hurry!
- Go!

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.570
Quick!

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.700
Hurry! Stop her! Don't let her get away!

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.860
Qin Nan, let's go!

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:49.730
Qin Nan.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.220
Pull her away!

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.460
Grab her!

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.020
Sit tight.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.940
Quick. Stop him!

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.650
Stop!

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:00.610
Hurry up!

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.250
What are you guys good for?

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.530
What did you do?

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.460
I insulted them.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.860
Why?

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.730
Because they threatened me!

Where are we going?

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:51.700
To celebrate.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.380
Celebrate what?

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.530
To celebrate Ye Sibei

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:56.940
finally growing up.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.490
I'm 28 already.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.530
I've been an adult for years.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:07.820

That's what happened earlier.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:32:59.730
Are you scared?

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.180
The old Ye Sibei would be scared.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.940
But not the new Ye Sibei.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.420
But I can't figure it out.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.010
Why are there so many people

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.150
who defend the bad person

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.570
but not protect the good?

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:25.730
Some do it for gain.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.980
Like people in your company.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.700
Letting a powerless woman

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.700
admit she framed her superior

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.010
is easier than letting a top executive

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.860
face the shame.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.980
Some do it to comfort themselves

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.220
that accepting

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.940
someone deserves punishment

00:33:48.288 --> 00:33:49.755
is easier than accepting

00:33:49.777 --> 00:33:51.180
a crime without reason.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:53.490
Because they can believe

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.090
they'll be safe

00:33:56.844 --> 00:33:58.490
as long as they don't commit sin.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.460
That's the victim-blaming theory.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.220
What else?

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.380
Some are just tradition.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.530
But no matter the reason,

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:12.900
there are all kinds of people.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.010
Some will oppose you.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:16.860
Some will stand by you.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.140
It's just that

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.210
good people are ignored more

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.780
and silenced more easily.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.260
Look at them more.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.260
Don't lose heart.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.260
And you?

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.050
If good and evil have causes,

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.860
why are you by my side?

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.810
Have you dated

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.780
before we got married?

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.050
No.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.460
Have you liked someone before?

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.980
I don't know if it counts.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.460
But there was someone.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.460
I always wished her well.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.300
I never thought of being with her.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.740
But I always wished her well.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.220
I know.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.530
After what happened,

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.380
whether out of morals or pity,

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:56.940
you'd still help me.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.090
Thank you for staying with me.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.980
But now you saw

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.460
that I can do it alone.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.860
I can handle the case myself.

00:36:16.244 --> 00:36:18.066
I can go
to the provincial capital alone.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.940
I can live on my own.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.610
You don't have to follow me everywhere.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:31.090
When we get back,

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.740
let's go to Civil Affairs Bureau
and finalize it.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.220
What if

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.010
I don't want to finalize it?

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.050
You've already done enough for me.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.900
I don't want you to be burdened by duty.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.170
What if it isn't duty?

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.010
Even without me,

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.780
you'd still keep moving forward.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.580
Without me,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.740
you'd still fight for what's right.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.460
You'd start to resist.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.010
You'd learn from failure.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.260
Then one day,

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.490
maybe because of a sentence,

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.220
a book,

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:37.780
or a netizen

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.860
who'd tell you you were right,

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.490
you'd go back to the police

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:45.010
and report it.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.940
You'll keep going alone.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.940
It's always been Ye Sibei who decides.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.780
Anyone could be Qin Nan.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.780
If it's only duty,

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.300
you wouldn't need me anymore.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.260
Why

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.130
do you think I'm here?

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:17.490
Why?

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.050
Must I really say it aloud?

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.610
You haven't answered me.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:12.010
What is it?

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.980
Why celebrate my coming of age?

00:39:16.577 --> 00:39:17.940
Because I think being grown

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.340
isn't the same as being legal.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.420
How's it different?

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.420
Learning to face the world

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.420
in your own way is adulthood.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.860
Let me ask one more question.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.780
Why so many questions?

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:41.050
It's the last one.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.260
Go on.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.260
What's good

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.740
about someone like me?

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.860
Everything's good.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.420
Let me count.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.340
You're tough, stubborn, defiant,

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.980
and never give up.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.420
Even poor, you'd fold paper

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.420
to shade the lamp.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.260
You'd buy pretty hair clips.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.820
You'd match plates when eating.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.340
You'd choose different cups to drink.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.940
On weekends,

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.610
you'd iron your clothes nicely.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.940
Wherever you go,

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.420
you carry that dandelion flower

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.940
and care for it carefully.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.780
Ye Sibei.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.050
You have many good qualities.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.260
You're truly wonderful.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.740
Go to sleep.
