00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.410
(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
=Episode 4=

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.290
Why did you come back?

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.450
Do you...

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.980
Do you want something to eat?

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.820
Have a seat first.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.980
When did you start drinking?

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.780
Just...

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.610
Just recently.

00:03:11.977 --> 00:03:13.410
Did you buy the cigarettes too?

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.850
Sibei.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.220
What's going on with you?

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.690
I...

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.380
Nothing.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.340
Work has just been stressful lately.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.690
I needed to let off some steam.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.980
It's not a big deal.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.130
I just had a few drinks.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.380
I'm an adult now.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.500
That's not illegal, right?

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.820
Do you have anything to tell me?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.690
You came for the divorce papers, didn't you?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.690
Or do you want to finalize it today?

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.100
I'll get them for you.

00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:09.780
Why did you
suddenly agree to the divorce?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.780
Can you give me a reason?

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.980
There's no reason.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.810
You want a divorce, so be it.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.580
What happened

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.140
on the night of April 9th?

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.220
I'll get you a pen.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.900
On the night of April 9th,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.410
your company had a drinking engagement.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.700
You got drunk.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.490
You and Chuchu
got into Fan Jiancheng's car.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.460
After Chuchu was dropped off,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.140
you were taken to the canola field.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.290
When you woke up,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.730
you called the police.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.930
But why you withdrew the report

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.930
when they arrived?

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.450
Ye Sibei.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.330
Who was it?

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.900
Since you already know everything,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.140
what's left to say?

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.980
Does it matter who it was?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.930
I'm not reporting it.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.780
Was it Fan Jiancheng?

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.450
I don't remember.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.340
One of the bosses

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.460
at the drinking engagement
loves drinking.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.460
He insisted I drink too.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.170
I didn't want to trouble everyone,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.460
so I drank what they poured.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.700
Later, my mom called me

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.290
about our divorce.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.780
We argued.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.700
And somehow,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.140
I drank a few more glasses.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.460
After that,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.140
Fan Jiancheng offered to drive me home.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.730
He said I asked to get off

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.220
when we were almost home.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.340
But I don't remember anything.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.900
When I woke up the next day,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.850
I was in a canola field.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.100
I called the police

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.930
and asked them to bring me a coat.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.170
The police are willing to help you.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.290
So am I.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.580
Why carry this burden alone?

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.930
I've figured it out.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.980
What good would reporting it do?

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.100
People would just say
it was my fault anyway.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.140
It's like when kids fight.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.780
You get hit on the left cheek.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.660
Why go home just to get hit

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.700
on the right too?

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.290
It takes two to tango.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.660
I wasn't careful enough.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.370
It's not a big deal.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.580
I'll just forget it.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.300
I just

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.850
did you wrong.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.810
What did you do wrong?

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.900
You just did your job.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.780
Going home after work.
What did you do wrong?

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.980
It doesn't matter.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.980
Forget it.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.170
Let's go to the police.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.690
No.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.650
No!

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.460
It's over.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.290
I didn't report it then. Why now?

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.260
I'm fine.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.290
I don't need to make a police report.
I don't need!

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.733
If you don't report to the police,
will you really be fine?

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.410
I'll do fine.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.730
I don't need to call the police.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.980
If you want a divorce, then do it.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.810
I only ask one thing.
Just let it go, okay?

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.980
As long as we stay silent,

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.980
this will be over.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.810
I'll pack up.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.900
I'll pack up right now.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.290
Ye Sibei.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.100
If the harm isn't fairly addressed,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.780
the wound will stay rotten forever.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.850
This is only the beginning.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.780
You'll slowly rot from inside out.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.980
You'll spend half your life

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.370
trying to heal that wound.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.250
You'll keep wondering

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.580
why it happened to you

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.980
and what you did wrong.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.610
Why the one who hurt you

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.700
can live well,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.490
while you end up like this?

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.900
Everything you do now...

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.460
Everyone will pity you

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:10.900
because you're a victim.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.460
But in the future

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.810
when people forget your pain

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.170
and only see what your life became,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.580
they'll just think

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.900
Ye Sibei is worthless.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.140
So what?

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.610
I'm worthless.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.340
My mom said

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.700
we must accept fate.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.490
Fate can be changed!

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.140
Sibei.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.370
You must try to win once.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.180
Just once.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.420
But I've never won!

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.890
You think I haven't tried?

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.820
I tried.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.610
When I was little,

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.460
I thought studying hard
could change my life.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.300
But it didn't.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.300
I thought working hard

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.340
could change my life.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.180
But it didn't.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.700
I thought the hardest time
was always now

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.300
and that better days would come
once I got through it.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.580
But in the end,

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.610
there's always more pain ahead.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.130
There are always harder things

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.700
waiting in the future.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.460
I'm not disciplined enough.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.610
Not smart enough.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.770
Not careful enough.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.130
I'm foolish, sentimental,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.310
low in emotional IQ,
and married with no kids.

00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:27.420
No company wants me.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.370
How can I be picky?

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.100
I have a degree

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.700
but still earn 3,500 yuan a month.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.730
Haven't I been blamed enough?

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.980
You tell me to win,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.940
but how can I win?

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.250
I only want one thing now.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.420
I want to live well.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.850
I want to live like an ordinary person.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.820
No fighting, no rebellion,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.820
just go with the flow,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.220
and live without any expectation.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.250
Is that too much to ask?

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.770
You say you want to give up,

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.610
but inside lives another you,

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.100
who never gave up.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.460
Sibei.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.420
If you want to live

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.610
like a normal person,

00:10:55.644 --> 00:10:57.300
then report to the police with me.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.850
Why are you here?

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.610
Chuchu said

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.610
Nan beat up Fan Jiancheng.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.460
So I came to see.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.370
I heard you arguing, so I didn't knock.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.130
Maybe I should come inside first.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.970
Nianwen.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.090
Move aside.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.490
Calling the police now

00:12:26.977 --> 00:12:28.460
will have a low chance of winning.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.460
Is that what you should tell your sister?

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.300
Is that what a lawyer should say?

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.650
I can't let her fight a losing case!

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.010
You're not her.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.220
You're not her family.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.610
You don't know her pain.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.820
Everyone will doubt her from the start.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.530
Why did she drink that night?

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.530
What was her relation to the defendant?

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.530
They'll examine her past, her family,

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.180
every act they call improper.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.940
They'll say she seduced him and framed him.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.733
If she loses the case,

00:12:54.755 --> 00:12:56.770
they'll say she set him up in a honey trap.

00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:58.060
They'll say she asked
for money and failed.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.420
She was trying to be a homewrecker.
Even accusing her of indecent work.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.130
I understand your anger.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.980
If you can't accept it,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.420
you can get a divorce.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.420
But I can't watch you ruin my sister.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.770
You saw me at the hospital that day, right?

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.770
You said those things on purpose,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.340
just to make me give up reporting it?

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.260
Don't follow me.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.580
(Gynecology Clinic)

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.450
Don't force it.

00:13:42.577 --> 00:13:43.850
What kind of parent is this?

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.730
Let him go.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.850
Look.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.530
You've already fought twice
at the beginning.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.130
If you can't even handle this,

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.850
what will you do after we report it?

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.340
Violence solves nothing.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.130
Everyone's very clear-headed.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.850
My mom.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:07.730
My brother.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.610
Everyone's very clear-headed.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.730
All of you should go.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.010
I want to be alone for a while.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.610

Nan.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.180
You knew all along.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.700
Even your mom knew.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.050
You're indeed a family.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.700
Nan, listen to me.

00:17:35.733 --> 00:17:36.940
My sister didn't call the police

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.250
because my mom and I stopped her.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.250
All the blame is on us.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.330
She wasn't weak.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.620
I know she wasn't weak.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.050
You're the one who's weak.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.250
When you failed to join a key high school,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.900
your mom paid the school placement fee.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.330
To pay that fee,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.250
she refused to spend a cent on Ye Sibei.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.940
Your sister found a way
to finish high school

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.050
and get into college.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.740
In college,

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.570
you asked for money to date

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.380
and join clubs.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.250
And your sister?

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.250
She worked part-time to make money.

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:07.180
She even felt ashamed to ask your mom

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.250
for a computer.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.250
After graduation,

00:18:10.733 --> 00:18:12.755
you ate what your family cook,
used what they gave,

00:18:12.755 --> 00:18:14.377
lived under their roof
and lived off them.

00:18:14.733 --> 00:18:16.711
Even after marriage,
you asked them for money.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.490
Ye Nianwen.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.940
Do you know
where your down payment came from?

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.050
It was your sister.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.940
She took a credit loan to help you.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.111
She borrowed 100,000 yuan.

00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:29.490
Ye Nianwen, don't you realize it?

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.620
Don't you know?

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.980
Nan.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.010
But I... I really didn't know about it.

00:18:36.066 --> 00:18:37.444
You're not supposed to know?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.940
Are you not supposed to know?

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.650
No.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.050
You could have known.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.770
You just didn't want to.

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:51.250
Every time your parents
did something wrong for you,

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.900
you chose to stay silent.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.460
Because you enjoyed

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.220
everything taken from your sister.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.420
You were afraid to lose this easy life.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.490
Everything your sister

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.730
sacrificed for you,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.900
you always learned one step too late.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.490
And you'd apologize

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.380
to ease a bit of your guilt.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.570
Ye Nianwen.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.730
If you had lived like a man just once,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.730
your sister
wouldn't be where she is today!

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:24.770
You didn't dare report to the police.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.050
You keep saying it's for her good.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.330
Is that really for her good?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.250
Do you not know how she lives now?

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.700
You call that helping her?

00:19:37.133 --> 00:19:38.940
You just don't want trouble for yourselves.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.420
That way, everyone

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.810
can keep living peacefully.

00:19:47.022 --> 00:19:48.050
Everyone but your sister.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.250
But I truly hoped she...

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.490
You're just spineless.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.700
You're a parasite.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.010
You fed on your family's blood,

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.050
yet pretend to be a just and kind hypocrite.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.940
If you truly cared for her,

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.660
and loved your sister,

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.700
you'd have fought for her once.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.180
You'd tell her

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.290
she wasn't wrong.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.140
She deserves to live

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.700
with her head held high.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.050
But have you ever done that?

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.180
You haven't.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.980
All these years,

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:35.050
I kept wondering why Ye Sibei's life

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.330
turn out this way.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.700
Now I finally understand.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.180
It's because of your whole family.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.330
Every single one of you,

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:47.660
including me.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.050
None of us ever told Ye Sibei

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.180
she's never wrong for being born

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.460
and deserves to live well.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:03.940
Not once.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:20.770
Maybe...

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.860
Maybe even if I say it now,

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.330
you won't believe me.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.860
But I really hope she'll always be

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.860
the Ye Sibei I admire most.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.300
Nan.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.460
I'll get going now.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.570
Tonight is Dad's birthday.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.220
If you two aren't coming,

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.290
I'll tell Mom and Dad for you.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:08.220
Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.660
Sibei.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.460
Sibei.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.010
Sibei!

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.660
Qin Nan.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.130
It's me.

00:25:05.288 --> 00:25:06.660
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.820
Sibei.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.020
Don't be afraid.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:24.890
Sibei.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:26.650
Sibei, wake up.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.130
Talk to me.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.170
Qin Nan.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.940
I wanted to fight, too.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:35.570
But I...

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.860
Every time I gathered courage,

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.330
someone told me to endure.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.050
They say it's for my good.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:47.770
But

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.900
it's been so hard to endure.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.260
Sibei.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.860
Hold on.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.770
You're not afraid of death,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.660
so why fear living?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.090
Qin Nan.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.980
I tried.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.280
I

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.570
really tried.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.860
I tried so hard to live.

Ye Sibei from Class 7, Year 1

Please welcome her.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.980
Hello.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.460
I'm Ye Sibei from Class 7, Year 1.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.570
Today,

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.420
my speech topic is

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.290
"The Best Is Always Yet to Come."

00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:59.730
We strive.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:00.620
We work hard.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.980
We fight on.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.730
We go through our darkest times.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.810
A bright future is within reach.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.140
No hardship is insurmountable.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.010
No despair lasts forever.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.570
If your heart holds tomorrow,

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.460
then tomorrow will arrive just as you dream it.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.660
On the road of growing up,

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.050
we can chase dreams,

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.220
create,

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.460
and grow wildly like spring.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.490
However,

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.380
two great mountains stand before us.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.570
One is denial.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.140
The other, disdain.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.770
They block our way forward.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.490
They press down till we can't breathe.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:41.770
We give in.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:42.700
We obey.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.770
We beg for mercy.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:44.530
- My troublemaker!
- The mountain...

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.700
Where have you been?

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.050
What are you carrying there?

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.340
Put it down.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.330
Gosh.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.770
You just changed clothes.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:51.700
What's this?

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.090
It's all dirt and unwashed.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.530
Take it off.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.010
It's fine, Mom.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.460
I just took it out of the river.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.330
Why are you standing?

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.170
Close the door.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:02.130
Grab a cloth.

00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:04.770
Don't move.
Let me see if you hurt your hands.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:06.290
What happened?

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.130
They're all red.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:08.220
Quick.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:08.970
Come with me.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:09.930
Take it off first.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.260
Wait.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:13.650
Let's go.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.180
Wipe it clean.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.060
How heavy.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.460
You brat.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.290
Let me see your hands.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.540
Rinse with water.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.540
Does it hurt?

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.700
It's okay.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.460
Disinfect it with alcohol.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.540
Here.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.540
Disinfect it.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.460
It'll sting. Bear with it.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.330
Don't scream.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.060
Sibei.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.980
Come help me at the stall tomorrow.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:39.900
The stall?

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.660
Mom.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.090
What do you mean by that?

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:44.530
Sleep early tonight.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.420
I'll wake you tomorrow.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.660
Breakfast rush is short.

00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:49.888
Customers leave
if they see that I'm too busy.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.220
Help me out,

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.250
and we'll earn more.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.980
But I'm about to start Year 3.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.090
Why should I work?

00:28:57.311 --> 00:28:59.577
You want to study Year 3 and college,
don't you?

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.140
What about your brother?

00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:03.644
We just paid
so much school placement fee for him.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.630
How can we afford both of you?

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.290
I won't drop out.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.170
I'll keep studying.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.270
Why are you so disobedient?

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.860
Don't you know

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.420
that your dad lost his job

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.660
because we had you.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.090
That's why life's so hard.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.700
You're lucky to study till now.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.820
Why are you crying?

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.420
Why can he study,

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.280
but I can't?

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.090
He's a boy.

00:29:24.622 --> 00:29:26.810
He'll provide for his family
and have a career.

00:29:27.111 --> 00:29:28.010
Without college,

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.770
how can he provide and succeed?

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.610
What about me?

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.010
What about my future?

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.220
Sibei, you're a girl.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.620
You'll marry one day.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.090
Besides, you're the eldest, right?

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:41.620
The eldest should give in.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.050
Your brother is the hope
of the Ye family.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.770
He's our only way out.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.020
Mom.

00:29:52.222 --> 00:29:53.466
I'll wake you in the morning.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.700
Mom.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.570
Almost there.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.770
Keep it up.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:09.620
(Nanbei Breakfast)

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.010
Sibei, why are you here?

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.980
Did you really drop out?

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.940
Well... Vegetable buns or meat buns?

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.450
How many?

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.410
Meat buns.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.610
Two.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:29.570
Two yuan.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.860
Sibei, you have such good grades.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.530
It's a pity you stopped studying.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:34.220
Yeah.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.940
With your grades, college is certain.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.050
Why did you quit school?

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.660
Are you done?

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.290
Almost.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:42.600
- I've waited a long time.
- Go to class first.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.220
You'll be late.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.420
- Bye.
- Coming.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.820
Two meat buns.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.900
Drink it.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:49.890
Come on.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.820
Wait.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.250
What are you doing?

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.220
Be careful.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.460
Just a moment.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:00.700
Sorry.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.770
One vegetable bun.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.060
Slow down.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.820
Mr. Yang.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.010
Sibei, quick, come sit.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.540
Sibei.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.460
I have good news for you.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.940
You can go back to school.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.300
Really?

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.660
Really.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.220
I can go back to school?

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.730
Yes, you've received

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.180
a targeted financial aid.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:51.290
With this money,

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.620
you can finish high school.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.530
That's wonderful news.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.860
I always believed children
should keep studying.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.660
But her mom thinks

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.700
girls don't need education.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.980
Now, that's solved.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.940
Sibei, come.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.780
Thank Mr. Yang.

00:32:09.222 --> 00:32:10.250
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:11.290
Sit.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:13.730
Mr. Yang.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.010
Who gave me the financial aid?

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.940
Don't ask too many questions.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.660
The donor

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.530
doesn't want others to know

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.180
too much about their identity.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.660
Anyway,

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.420
this money wasn't easy to get.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.900
I just want to ask you.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.660
Do you have the determination

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.490
to keep studying hard?

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.780
Yes.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:31.730
I do.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.140
Mr. Yang, I want to study.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.250
I want to go to college.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.970
Good.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.930
Good.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:36.980
Sibei, look.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.420
this money is limited after all.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.620
After you finish high school,

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.620
you'll still need money for college.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.140
What's your plan then?

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:46.530
Mr. Yang.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.530
I checked.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.490
College offers student loans,

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.010
and I can work part-time.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.810
All I need is a chance.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:54.530
Good. That's what I hoped to hear.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.490
Thank you so much.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.610
- So soon?

with resume screening.

- Sibei, you're always resourceful.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.490
I should've borrowed some too.

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:40.530
- I'll save some money.
- Learn from her.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.400
- My wallet hurts.
- Let's do it together later.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.780
Sure, we'll shop together next time.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.980
What makeup do you all use?

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.210
Hello, Mom?

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.260
Sibei.

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.050
Have you considered coming back home?

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.980
I found you a job at the local school

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.460
that many people are eyeing.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.860
Come back soon.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.460
Stop finding me jobs.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.570
I already have something here.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:04.650
What did you say?

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:05.820
What is it?

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:07.380
You're not coming back?

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.050
I'll talk to you later.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.890
Bye.

00:35:10.088 --> 00:35:12.210
I just hope
this afternoon's interview goes well.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.300
Smells good.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:13.860
What's wrong?

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.980
Your mom called again,
asking you to go back home?

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.610
Yes.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:17.690
Your mom...

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.380
You worked so hard to get into college.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.340
Why does she keep asking you to return?

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.010
But it's easier to find a job back home.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.940
And with her education, going back there

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.570
would be like a complete overkill.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:29.311
You're wrong.

00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:31.610
It's not just about
education background back home.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.300
You also need the right connections.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.300
Our family isn't rich or influential.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.740
I don't have the luxury to do nothing.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.530
There are more chances in the city.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.420
At least it's fair.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.580
I'm staying.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.170
You've got a point.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.490
But your mom...

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.010
Can you win against her?

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.530
I have to try whether I win.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.780
Anyway, I'm set on not going back.

00:35:58.488 --> 00:36:00.300
- That's not right.
- Here's the meeting file.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.210
Okay, thanks.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.820
Thanks.

00:36:03.844 --> 00:36:05.610
- Sibei, where's my coffee?
- Thanks, Sibei.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.890
Right here.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.450
Here you go.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.300
Thanks.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.140
Don't mention it.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.420
Mr. Liu.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.460
Your delivery.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.650
Thanks.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:14.490
Ling.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.610
This one's yours.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:16.860
Thanks.

00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:19.610
Ms. Wang, this is yours.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.860
Ye Sibei.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.570
Meeting in ten minutes.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:23.940
Prepare the conference room.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.820
Okay.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:28.170
Who can help sort
this morning's meeting agenda?

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.010
I can.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.490
Everyone, Ms. Liu is sick.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.780
Who can handle
this quarter's financial report?

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.420
I can.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.733
We're short-staffed in supplies.

00:36:35.755 --> 00:36:36.980
Who can lend a hand?

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.820
I can.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.050
Sibei.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:40.890
You work hard.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.090
Keep it up.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.340
If there's a permanent spot,

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.570
you'll be my first choice.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.130
Thank you, Mr. Li.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.860
I'll continue working hard.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.860
(There is no happier thing in the world
than to fight for an ideal)

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.700
(Pay Slip)

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:04.410
(Nianwen: Sibei.)

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:05.820
(I want to buy a PSP.)

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:06.980
(Can you)

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.090
(give me some money?)

00:37:08.644 --> 00:37:10.066
(I'll transfer it to you later.)

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.170
Be careful not to drop it.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:18.700
You're back.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:22.690
Cooking?

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:23.530
You're back.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.530
(Mom: You make
just over 2,000 yuan a month,)

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:56.980
(and you have to rent a place.)

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.844
(I don't know
what you're working so hard for.)

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.690
(Don't be so selfish.)

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.980
(You ignore your whole family,)

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.820
(just to live your own carefree life.)

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:20.300
(Tengda Construction Group)

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.170
Hello, Madam.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.610
Hello.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.260
I'm Ye Sibei's mother.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.940
I'm here to see my daughter.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:36.900
Madam.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.050
We don't allow anyone to enter.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.555
Ye Sibei is in a meeting right now.

00:38:39.577 --> 00:38:40.570
Have a seat for a bit.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.170
Wait here for a moment.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.700
Alright.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.420
Okay, let's take a look

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.050
at an overview of this project first.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.820
First, the location.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.530
It's in Linjiang City,
Jiangbei New District.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.090
To the east
is International Eco Conference Plaza.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:00.900
To the west, Guanshan Lake's mountains.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.420
And the design uses...

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.260
Sibei.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.090
Lunch is here. Go grab it.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:05.930
Okay.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.380
Let's continue.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.340
Hello, your order's here.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:20.860
Thanks.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.700
You're welcome.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.340
So this is the job
you found in the city?

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.300
Serving tea and running errands.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:30.820
Waiting on other people.

00:39:31.555 --> 00:39:32.977
Mom, what are you doing here?

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.340
I came to see you.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.900
You don't miss us, but we miss you.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.170
I just don't get it.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:38.340
What's so great about the city?

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.340
Why won't you come home?

00:39:39.644 --> 00:39:41.600
You don't answer calls
or reply to messages.

00:39:42.555 --> 00:39:43.860
- Mom.
- Let me take a good look.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.860
Mom, what are you doing?

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.860
Part of the construction development...

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.340
Come on, let's eat.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:48.860
I didn't even wear gloves.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.130
Come on, time to eat.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:51.570
What a big company.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.130
There are so many people here,
yet no one helps my girl.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.260
Aren't you just bullying

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.300
a kid fresh out of college?

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.130
Here, take this.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:57.860
Let me feed you.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.170
I'm telling you. She quits!

00:39:59.222 --> 00:40:00.400
What are you doing?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.380
What did you do?

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:01.940
What?

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.090
Don't make a scene, alright?

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.530
I'm about to become permanent.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:05.570
I'm taking you home.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:06.900
Turning permanent?

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.380
You're still dreaming.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.420
I'm telling you.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.260
I'm staying right here today.
I'll wait all day.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.420
Wherever you go, I follow.

00:40:13.222 --> 00:40:14.644
You're doing this on purpose?

00:40:14.733 --> 00:40:16.610
If you want to
bring me back to Nancheng...

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.650
I'm telling you.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.820
I won't agree.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.530
Are you sure?

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:25.610
Hello.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.130
Who's the boss here?

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.570
Boss, let me tell you something.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:29.900
I'm Ye Sibei's mother.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.010
I hereby announce my daughter's quitting.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:32.780
Why's that?

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.260
This company is terrible.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.820
- Mom!
- All dressed up, yet...

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.090
You can't even say thanks
after getting tea served to you.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.340
What's wrong with this woman?

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.866
Madam, who are you calling terrible?

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.090
I'm sorry.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.420
I didn't expect her mom to...

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.940
I'm sorry, boss.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.610
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:49.690
Enough, stop talking.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:50.900
I've seen enough.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.700
Ye.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.260
Why did you
bring your family drama to work?

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.530
I'm sorry.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:58.690
From today on,

00:40:58.690 --> 00:40:59.530
you're fired.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:01.610
Leave the company.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:04.740
Thank you.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.490
Let's go.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.260
Sir, please give me another chance.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.260
Enough, stop talking.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.260
Go to HR for your resignation.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.940
She got fired.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.940
She just graduated.
Finding a job isn't easy.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.288
She was about to get permanent.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.780
Ms. Wang.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.860
Ms. Wang, what are you doing? Ms. Wang.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:44.220
Young lady.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.340
I'm sorry.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.260
I've spoken to you several times.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.340
If you don't pay rent,

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.690
I have no choice
but to make you leave this way,

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.130
Didn't I tell you?

I've already paid the agency.

I've been calling them every day.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:57.820
Young lady, don't you get it?

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.340
The agency took your money and ran.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.820
Aren't you silly?

Get your head straight.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.490
This kind of thing
won't have any result.

Ms. Wang.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.690
Give me a few more days.

Okay?

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.690
Ms. Wang, give me a few more days.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:21.570
