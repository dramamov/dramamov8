00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.840
Whoa...

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.280
Are you sure this is a house,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.680
not a palace?

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.040
This way, Young Master Apo.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.840
Welcome home, Apo Yue!

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.440
Wait, but this is just a homecoming...

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.920
Does it really have to be this extra?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.000
Here's your welcome drink,
Young Master Apo.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.200
Welcome home, my dear son!

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.800
Everyone's happy now that you're home!

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.705
I'm... I'm also happy.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.000
Good job, folks!

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.600
Nice work!

00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:06.286
I'll prepare the bath water for you.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920
Thank you...

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.720
What?

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.020
A bill counter?

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.600
Am I in a bank or something?

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.280
That's the hot angel.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.360
Wait...

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.040
Why is he here?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.080
What a soft,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.965
comfortable bed!

00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:39.760
This is so freaking comfy!!

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.200
And a spacious room at that!

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120
Boom!

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.800
Such a diva move!

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.960
Young Master,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.920
the bath tub is ready.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:04.960
Okay...

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.960
- Is that a real giraffe?!
- The mineral water from the Alps

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.360
at 37 degree Celsius,
just how you prefer.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.800
I've already added some milk oil

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.720
in a proper ratio to the water

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.840
to protect
and nourish your skin, Young Master.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.600
Whoa!

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.480
Auntie...what are you doing?

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.160
Oh...

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.920
I'll give you a bath, of course.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.760
It's... It's okay.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.160
It's better if you wait outside.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.440
Uh, sure.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.200
Uh, I'm fine.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.400
I want to give myself a bath.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.600
Can you do it?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.280
- I can.
- Alright...

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.240
This is
the first nice bath in my life

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.060
- since I was born...
- Young Master!

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.100
Yes?!

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.560
Are you completely sure?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.787
Uh, I am...

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.920
Please go outside, Auntie...

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.400
And lock the door if you could.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.680
Sure.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.760
Please watch out for the slipperiness.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.280
- Uh, alright.
- Alright, then.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.560
I'm right outside.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.280
I've prepared some outfits for you.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.000
Which one
would you like to wear for dinner?

00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:25.640
Uh, dinner?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.440
That's right.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.600
Alright.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.280
These are all from
your favorite collections, Young Master.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.600
Where's the dinner?

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.480
At home, Young Master.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.400
At home?

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.560
Right...

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.880
People wear this to dinner?

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:37.880
Yes...

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.920
Young Master...

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.640
are you sure?

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.440
Yes.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.570
It's a normal fit, isn't it?

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.960
The Young Master is ready!

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.560
- These look really good.
- Certainly.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.560
Appetizing!

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.600
Allow me to serve
the roasted suckling pig.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.960
Go ahead.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.960
These are all your favorite dishes, Apo.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.680
Do you remember who this is?

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.840
This is Ashin,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.440
your older brother, dear.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560
Oh...

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.760
Good evening, Ashin!

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.160
My apologies!

00:18:41.893 --> 00:18:43.520
Papa, Mama...

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.760
he must be hit really hard in the head.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.838
He never greeted me like that,

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.200
and always acted like I smell
when he sees my face.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.120
That's out of nowhere.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.520
Uh, should we eat now?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.480
Otherwise, the food's gonna be cold

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.240
and not as good.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.880
Here you go.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320
Wait,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.760
we can't start just yet.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.480
We have to wait
for your important guest.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.240
My important guest?

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:17.880
Mm!

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.120
This is...

00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:39.413
the hot guy
that stares me down from the hospital.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.880
You don't remember anyone at home,

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.880
but do you remember him?

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.320
I only remember...

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.100
how handsome he is...

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720
Uh...

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.200
So...

00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:01.446
- you are...
- Oi,

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.080
he's one important person in your life.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.160
If you forget him,
he's gonna be desperately dejected!

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.800
Su...

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.360
Su...

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.880
Su...

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.720
Sumi...

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.440
Su...

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.640
Uh, Su...

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.640
Like hell I can remember!

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.520
I'm not even Apo!

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.720
Suriya.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.580
M.R. Suriya

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.320
Suriyadechakorn,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.160
your fiancé.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.240
My...

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.800
My fiancé?!

00:20:52.464 --> 00:20:53.464
Uh, right...

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.960
The body's owner has a fiancé?

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.160
That means...

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.360
I have to marry him?

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.120
Apo...

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.760
Are you quite alright?

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.120
I've only seen you
taken a few bites before you came out.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.920
I'm... I'm fine.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.800
Or is it that...

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.840
you're avoiding me?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.000
I'm not avoiding you.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.320
Apo,

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.600
look at me for just a bit.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.280
Uh...

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.200
I...

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.320
If there's anything on your mind,

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.540
you can tell me,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.200
baby.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.640
"Baby," he said?

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.840
Why are we calling each other "baby"?

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.760
You're silly!

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.120
Argh!

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:32.880
Uh...

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.040
Do you want to know
how we become lovers?

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.640
How does he know what I think?

00:22:57.006 --> 00:22:59.646
I guess your memory
hasn't properly recovered...

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.680
Tomorrow,

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.280
why don't we go on a date
to remind you of us?

00:23:25.766 --> 00:23:31.666
[Mr. Fiancé]

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.970
Whoa...

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.600
It seems like
Apo is madly in love with that Mister,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.400
while he looks like
he was forced out of bed.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.920
What's going on between these two?

00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:49.800
[Apo: I booked a fine-dining place, Ya
Suriya: Okay]

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.040
[Apo: Where are you? I miss you!
Suriya: In a meeting]

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.280
[Apo: What are you doing?
Apo: Done with the meeting? IMY!]

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.560
[Apo: Morning, Mr. Fiancé
Apo: Have a good meeting!]

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.720
One-sided conversation?

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.120
So it's a one-sided love?

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.760
I thought I hit the jackpot

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.680
by reincarnating
in a parallel world as Young Master Apo,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.720
but I'll have to marry a random guy.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.320
He's a snack and everything,

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.480
but it's a deal-breaker if he's weird!

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.520
If this is how things are,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.200
will I really get to live
happily ever after?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.620
No, no, no!

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.680
I'm not getting married!

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.160
Papa!

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.760
It's really late.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.280
Why aren't you going to bed?

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.920
I'm worried about you,
so I thought I might stop by.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.740
Apo,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.080
get a good rest

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.560
so that your memory quickly returns.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.960
When you're better,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.880
you'll get engaged to His Excellency

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.760
and get your happy ending.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.040
Mama and I will also be at ease.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.960
Uh...

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.440
you said

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.240
you wanted me to be happy, right?

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.200
Mm.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
What if

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.720
I told you

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.440
my happiness is not marriage anymore?

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.800
It's fine

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.120
because your memory hasn't returned.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.320
When it does,

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.120
you'll be happy about it again.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.560
No, that's not what I meant.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.400
I...

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.400
I'm not into him anymore,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.240
- Eh?
- and he...

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.000
doesn't seem to be
into me all that much.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.720
It's gonna be
a failed marriage eventually.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.080
You don't want to see
your son miserable, do you?

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.880
Haiya...

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.800
Then,

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.200
can we cancel the wedding?

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.600
We can, actually.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.920
But I'll also
cancel your name in my will.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.800
What?

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.400
Don't "what" me.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.240
I'll disinherit you entirely

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.920
if you don't marry His Excellency.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.600
Papa!

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.480
And if you must insist,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.640
don't call me Papa ever again!

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.800
Mark my words!

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600
Alright, alright,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.900
I think you should go to sleep,

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.350
so you have a speedy recovery.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.920
Come on, get a lot of rest.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960
Lay down.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.080
Quick.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.520
Come on.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.280
Go to bed.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.200
Rise and shine.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:26.920
- Whoa!
- Uh...

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.240
Are you okay?

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.440
Sorry about that...

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.640
Wait a sec.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.480
Why would I be nice to him?

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.320
If I can't call off the wedding,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.040
then I'll give him a crash out

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.760
so intense that he breaks up with me!

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.480
I don't feel bad for you.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.200
This…

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.720
is not the half of what you deserve.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.000
Flabbergasted, huh?

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.680
And this is just
level 1 of the evilness.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.200
And who on earth
allowed you to come in my room?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.320
Your parents.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.560
They saw that you slept in late,

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.960
so they asked me to wake you up.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.920
Late for what?

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.000
I don't have to go anywhere, do I?

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.800
Where am I going?
I'm not going anywhere!

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.040
I'm...sleepy!

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.400
I want to sleep, don't you get it?

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.520
Leave me alone!

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.520
Gosh,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.440
please, all I want is to sleep.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.040
I'm begging you, just leave!

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.480
We have a date today,

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.640
did you forget?

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.160
Which is the best stocks
to invest in right now?

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.200
With the current state of the economy,
I think the international ones are...

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.070
Young Master Apo is here... Eek!

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.200
How 'bout that?

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.440
My outfit delivers.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.600
My hair delivers.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.840
My earrings deliver.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.200
I deliver...

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.720
like a delivery guy I was!

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.480
Apo, Apo...

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.600
why are you dressed like that?

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.520
You have a date today, don't you?!

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.440
Do you want to go change?

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.240
This is what I like, Mama.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.760
To be myself is to be free, right?!

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.840
If Ya can't handle this,

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.960
- then he can leave...
- Of course, I can handle it.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.480
He's pretty cute
when he dresses like this.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320
I like it.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840
I want this one,

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.760
this one,

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.960
this one,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.800
this one,

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.760
this one,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.000
and that one.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.040
Put them on this gentleman's bill.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.560
If I didn't feel bad for him,

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.800
I'd even ask for
the most expensive item in the store.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.280
Which one
is the most expensive item?

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.680
The most expensive item?

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.360
This is the one.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.680
Then, I'll take it.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.200
As for the rest,
deliver them to Apo's house.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.520
Of course.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.920
I want to play this game.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.240
How 'bout that?

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.000
Embarrassed?

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.800
That's a question for myself!

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.840
Am I embarrassed?

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.280
Good job.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.960
With the hard work
you put into dancing,

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.520
I guess I should take you
to a nice restaurant.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.320
With that coy face of his,

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.360
I thought it was gonna be easy.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.840
A tough one, I see.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.720
Here comes the ultimate dish

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.240
to make sure he learns the hard way!

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.880
How 'bout that?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.160
Meet Soi Ju, the raw beef signature!

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.320
Let's see

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.880
if he could eat it!

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.160
Come on,

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.730
I'll give you the big piece.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.240
Big bite.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.280
Big bite!

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.560
What? Here!

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.400
Here's the freshest, juiciest raw beef.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.440
Eat up.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.440
I don't eat raw beef.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.600
Can you show me how?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.120
What do you mean you don't eat it?

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.840
What's so hard
about opening up your mouth

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880
and chew it?

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.200
How 'bout that?

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.000
I guess the Big Ju

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.640
is the ultimate ick for him.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.280
Hmm!

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.600
This is delicious!

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.160
What?! He actually ate it?!

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.760
All thanks to you, Apo,

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.200
for taking me here;

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.800
otherwise, I would have
never discovered how good this is.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.080
How should I break it to him

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.080
that I don't want to get married?

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.160
He's gotta know

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.880
I'm not the real Apo!

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.240
I knew at first glance.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.440
Uh, you did?

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.840
What did you know?

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.400
What?
How does he know what I'm thinking?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.880
It's like he can read my mind.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.000
"What?
How does he know what I'm thinking?

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.720
It's like he can read my mind."

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.240
That's right.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.370
I can read your mind.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.880
Huh?!

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.840
- People in this world can read minds?!
- "Can read minds?!"

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.760
I knew from the first time we met

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.680
that you were not Apo.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.800
If you don't want me
to tell the Yue family

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.080
that you're not their son,

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.160
then...

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.060
what would you say if we work together?

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.160
No matter what,
I'll have to marry for business,

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.440
and you

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.360
will remain in this body.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.480
So...

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.320
should we just get married,

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.720
Mr. Apo in disguise?

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.020
All things considered...

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.960
might as well give it a shot!

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.240
From now on,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.960
I'll train you to become the real Apo.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.920
First,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.440
you need a makeover.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.440
Keep in mind that Apo is a fashionista.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.240
Your outfits need layering,

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.880
- and accessories are indispensable.
- Take these.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.760
This is what you call elegance

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.320
and monarch,

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.760
deserving of Apo.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.640
Laying it on thick?

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.870
But I do think...

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.320
we're missing something.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.560
Let's see.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.400
Give me your left hand.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.040
Come on.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.840
This is the right Apo.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.560
Secondly,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.720
as Apo is the young master
of the Yue family,

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.160
his manner is flawless
in every movement.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.410
The dishes we're gonna eat today

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.760
will come in different courses,

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.480
and the cutlery seen before you

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.240
is arranged according to the order

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.120
that the dishes will be served.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.160
First, we'll start from the baked goods.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.640
Break it off

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.080
into a bite-size piece.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.440
Scoop some butter,

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.400
and spread it on.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.440
Next up is how to eat soup.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.960
Scoop away from you,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.480
and eat from the side of the spoon.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.120
Coming up next is the main course.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.400
Place the knife like so,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.920
cut it,

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.440
and put it in your mouth
with the front facing you.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.480
Beef is to be paired with red wine,

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.760
and the proper way to drink it

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.240
is hold the glass by the stem

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.600
so that your body temperature
doesn't interfere with the wine's.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.440
Then, give it a swirl,

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.560
exposing the wine to some air.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.840
Cheers.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.120
You're a grown-up
who can't drink alcohol?

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.520
Well,

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.280
who'd be born
holding a glass of wine like you,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.240
Your Excellency?

00:37:32.264 --> 00:37:33.064
Hey.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.280
Third,

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.320
the real Apo must be a diva.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.480
He's arrogant and spoiled.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.040
More.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.280
More passion!

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.480
More energy!!

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.810
This... This doesn't look arrogant.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240
This looks ridiculous.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.480
What?

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.680
You weren't clear with the briefing.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.160
If you can do it,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.440
why don't you show me?

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.960
How was it?

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.440
Your turn now.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.020
Smile widely.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.000
Smile!

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.520
Then, raise your eyebrows.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.200
Stop smiling.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.440
That's your Apo face.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.720
Smile the least you can,

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.000
and if you have to,

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.680
just smirk.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.720
Or if you have to look at someone,

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.680
just give them a side eye.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.280
Keep your chin up.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.720
Now, try it.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.000
What's wrong with your nostrils?

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.160
Nothing!

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.800
My son is the cutest!

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.840
Would you like some water, Young Master?

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.760
No.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.600
How about some tea?

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.640
No.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320
How about some orange juice.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.400
No.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.040
What should we do?

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:18.720
No!!

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.400
I haven't said anything!

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.720
Uh, I think he's trying to say

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.400
that he doesn't want any drinks

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.240
and to just skip to the meal.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.160
Your Excellency,

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.160
you know Apo really well!

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.440
What an adorable couple!

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.040
How about this?

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.560
Let's all have a meal now.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.640
- Let's go.
- Sounds good.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.280
- Put these away!
- Thanks.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.600
The duck is from a nice restaurant.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.920
- It's big, isn't it, Apo?
- This one is also good.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.800
Remember:

00:40:56.953 --> 00:40:58.960
For Apo, everything has to be perfect

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.200
and supreme.

00:41:00.848 --> 00:41:02.720
He won't settle for anything less.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.340
If he sees something
he doesn't like, he will blow up.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.160
Wow...

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.240
But these are all expensive dishes!

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.200
How could I even complain?

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.240
Ugh!

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.000
Here goes nothing!

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.720
- Ah!
- Goodness!

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.200
I want sour curry!

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.240
An A5 wagyu sour curry

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.400
topped with caviar eggs,

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.960
drizzled with truffle oil,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.520
and served as an Asian fusion twist!

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.640
As for these boring dishes,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.640
bear in your little minds

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.040
I don't care for them!

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:17.760
Understood?!

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.520
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes, Young Master.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.560
There.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.760
My dear brother is back.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.160
That's right!

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200
Indeed!

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.040
Apo, you've made a full recovery.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.400
I'm truly happy, dear!

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.760
Seeing Apo like this,

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.720
I'm feeling a lot better!

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.320
In that case,
for the engagement ceremony,

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.720
you can stick
to the same auspicious date!

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.960
Got it, Papa.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.660
You and Mama don't have to be worried,

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.880
whether it's about
the ceremony or Apo.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.760
I'll take good care of everything.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.750
That's amazing!

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.880
Are you happy

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.480
that we'll finally become one?

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.200
I couldn't be happier.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.080
Uh,

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.680
excuse me to eat in my own room;

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.400
otherwise, I'll puke it all out.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.160
Papa's Apo is finally back!

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.600
Also, there's one more thing

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.600
that will make you
resemble the real Apo.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.160
Wait,

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.920
there's more?!

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.680
The last one is very important;

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.700
the real Apo

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.360
is madly in love with me.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.990
Are you a narcissist?

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.120
If you have to send home your fiancé,

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.360
what would you do?

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.000
Bye-bye, sir.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.120
Don't you think we need more than that?

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440
We are engaged!

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.200
A sincere farewell to you.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.010
Bon voyage, Mr. Fiancé.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.440
There's a mosquito?

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.560
Ow!

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.760
What's the matter with you?!

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.680
Me?

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.680
Then,

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:01.000
tomorrow, I will take you
to the field training.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.080
Uh, field training?

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.200
Be prepared,

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.720
- Huh?
- got it?

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.280
[Love Sharing and Heart Weaving:

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.720
- May I have a picture?
- Sure.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.000
Look this way, please.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.480
You can move closer.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.760
Please smile.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.840
Hello, everyone.

in 'Hello, Hi-So'!

We are now at Siao Tawan Hotel,

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.440
for its event,

which is massively attended
by celebrities from around Thailand!

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.480
And the biggest sensation of all

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.320
is the couple
who owns a multi-billion durian farm,

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.520
Mr. Korn and Mr. Karn,

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.400

and gracing our presence in this event!

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.560
Looks like I gotta talk to them!

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.480
Ooh, here they are!

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.800

- Soup Gai.

The way you finish
each other's sentences

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.760
is so 'Couple of the Year'!

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.800
Really? Gai,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.560
don't tease Karn too much.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.880
He's all red now.

Mm!

The reason I brought you here today

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.200
is because I want you to see

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.600
how real couples act.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.200
That's all it takes to be a couple?

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.840
Easy as pie!

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.480
Wait, Your freaking Excellency?

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.600
Isn't this too close?

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.540
Don't...

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.640
Don't get any closer!

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.920
Or else, I'll...

Hello.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.960
As we're with two lovey-dovey couples,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.520
namely Korn and Karn

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.720
and Suriya and Apo,

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.200
today, I have a guessing game

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.600
to test how well these couples
know their partner!

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.280
The rule is simple:

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.000
I will ask a question,

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.520
and you guys will write your own answer

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.280
and your partner's on the board.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.600
Then, you'll all
reveal your answer at the same time.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.440
The couple that gets
more answers right is the winner!

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.560
Wow,

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.560
we'll have an edge on them
with this kind of game.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.620
- Exactly!
- Ooh!

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.280
You guys are a new one.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.080
How could you possibly even beat us?

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.320
Win the game

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.400
before you brag about the game.

I guess you are ready, aren't ya?

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.080

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.440
Suriya says
Apo likes to go to the beach!

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.160
And Apo says Suriya likes to go to...

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.600
- "My house"!
- Whoa!

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.520
- Woohoo!
- That's spicy, everyone!

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.080
I love it!

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.680
And the next question is...

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.640
Your favorite food!

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:06.840
- Ooh!
- Wow!

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.760
[Korn: Peking duck
Karn: Carbonara pasta]

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.640
Those are the same exact answers!

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.950
And Apo says
[Apo: Sour curry]

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.600
Suriya likes...Soi Ju!
[Suriya: Something hot]

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.200
Oh! So...

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.280
when did you take him
to eat that hot dish, Apo?

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.040
- Ooh!
- Soi Ju!

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.200
The last question is...

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:31.120
A favorite activity to do
when you're sad!

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.320
Gahh!

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.600
Here they go again
[Korn: Being together]

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.560
giving the same answers!
[Karn: Being together]

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.200
And Apo says Suriya likes to...

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.920
"Watch me dance."

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.200
- Ohh!
- Darn.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.150
It's unanimous!

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.960
The winner is
Mr. Korn and Mr. Karn!

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.280
Give them a round of applause!

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.000
That's so sweet!

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.320
So handsome!

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.680
Looking good!

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.640
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.960
Good job! Look at them!

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:06.600
Imagine how he will be

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.760
if they're together
even longer than this.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.600
I can't believe

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.440
Ya got every single answer right.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.320
I normally see
you're only interested in yourself,

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.600
not the other way around.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.680
Hey, are you trying to call me out?

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.520
Oh,

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.680
I heard that Apo
was just dismissed from the hospital.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.000
Are you feeling better now?

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.200
Are you being too hard
on your fiancé, Ya?

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.210
Hey...

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.130
You took him for events
right after he got out of the hospital?

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.760
Uh...

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.120
I'm better now.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.360
Absolutely fine.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.680
His Excellency
has been taking a good care of me.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:46.960
Uh...

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.760
Excuse my manners, but...

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.960
I'm not used to this

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.380
since I've only heard Apo calling him,

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.040
"Ya, my baby Ya!"

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.800
Oh...

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.280
But Apo calling him like that
is lovely in a different way.

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.600
Right, Ya?

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.960
Uh, right.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.440
Well, then,
please excuse me to use a toilet.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.880
Apo...seems different.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.400
He does?

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.040
Probably because
his memory hasn't fully returned.

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.680
He... He will get better.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.780
I'm not complaining.

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.480
He's different in an adorable way.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.120
Adorable?

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.480
Mm.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.640
Even a lot more than he was.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:44.240
Apo is not the only one who's different.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.280
You're also different, Ya!

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.720
- Mm!
- You didn't care about him before,

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.840
but look at you now!

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.240
You already fell for him, didn't you?

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.840
Didn't you?

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:01.770
No, I didn't.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.400
Out of ten questions,

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.960
you got zero right?

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.480
Be frank with me,

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.200
aren't you gonna
pay attention to me?

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.200
What?

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.160
I don't have mind reading ability
like someone else here.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.320
Neither do Korn and Karn,

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.600
yet they know each other by heart.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.760
People who love each other need to care

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.680
about what the other person likes.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.080
This is what we have to work on.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.640
We need to be more attentive.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.860
We need to care more.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.200
We're gonna break up anyway!

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.080
Why so serious?

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.320
We have a meal
scheduled with my family tomorrow.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.400
Be prepared,

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.400
and don't forget our training.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.560
Ugh, don't you see

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.920
how hard I was serving this past week?

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.320
Zero busting so far!

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.800
Just relax.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:20.720
Huh?

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.400
So realistic that we have to share
a real goodbye kiss?

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.040
Hey, I'm not forgetting it!

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.120
Even though
I've never been in a relationship,

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.360
I'm not all that naive or anything.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.960
Ugh!

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.680
Is anything wrong?

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.160
I...

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.440
I'm not into you anymore.

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.880
You just don't remember

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.360
how much you were into me.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.990
Geez!

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.880
You're so...

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.080
It's true that I used to be
madly in love with you,

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.120
but as of now,

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.200
I just don't.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.920
I'm into someone else!

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.080
My type now is a bad boy

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.240
who is rugged,

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.840
tanned,

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.160
tattooed,

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.420
and muscular!

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.160
The Korean-looking type
with good taste like you

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.780
is in the past.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.600
I don't believe you.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.160
Apo is head over heels in love.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.200
Watch.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.240
Ow!

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.640
- Oh!
- What?!

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.720
I'm so sorry.

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.120
I was...

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.600
falling in love.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.760
What?

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.160
Your tattoos...

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.640
are the biggest turn-ons.

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.320
If you don't mind,

00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.320
can I have your number

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.600
in case I want some raw meat?

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.040
45!

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.320
That's a number
of my shoe size, sweetheart!

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.600
He's my man!

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.280
Uh...

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.720
it's not what you think, ma'am.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.320
I was just tripping!

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.680
How about
you try tripping on my cleaver?!

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.400
Wait...

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.600
Wait, you!
