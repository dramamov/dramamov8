=Episode 11=
(The Flame of Vengeance)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.799
What's wrong?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.000
You seem lost.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.280
Seeing you so sad

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.479
really makes me happy.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.719
Why not tell me another thing

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.280
to cheer me up?

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.200
Why?

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.880
You're not interested
in your sister's matter?

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.280
What do you mean?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.880
Both you and your sister

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.000
are hosts
of the Wujian Chi pearl and Mei pearl.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.920
It's just that the same man
planted the pearl

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.480
on your sister and took it from her
hundreds of years ago.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.760
And that was Li Motong!

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:17.799
And now you're with
the man who killed your sister.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:21.879
How absurd.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.079
No way.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's absolutely impossible!

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.959
Believe it or not.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.400
You will never get his love.

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.319
To him,

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.120
you're nothing but a plaything

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.159
that can be thrown away anytime.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.879
We separated them
in such an extreme way.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.000
It was indeed despicable.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.400
Despicable?

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.840
Don't forget

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.040
I was saving her.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.439
Li Motong can't live

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.000
without the Mei pearl.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.039
You're part of Wujian,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.680
so you shouldn't be so indecisive.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.879
I can do anything

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.439
to achieve what I want.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.919
Li Motong!

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.159
Li Motong!

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.560
Yan, you...

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.919
I don't want to live in your shadow.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.319
I don't want to be your replacement!

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.520
What are you doing?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.960
I've never seen you as her substitute.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.120
From the very beginning,

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.360
you're the one I love.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.000
My sister's death...

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.360
Does it have anything to do with you?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.879
My sister died

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.000
because she carried the Chi pearl.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.199
It was planted by you a century ago.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.319
And you took it away after a century!

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.159
That's right.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.879
The Chi pearl was indeed
planted by me a century ago.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.080
So you've been lying to me all along.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.680
You treated my sister's body as a vessel

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.000
just because you're the Lord of Wujian.

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.000
How cruel of you.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.120
Yan.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.919
Though I am the Lord of Wujian,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.879
Wujian has its own rules.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.879
I had no choice.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120
It's Wujian's rule to slaughter humans.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.960
It's Wujian's rule to despise life.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.919
It's Wujian's rule

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.520
to use human bodies as vessels

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.680
and trample them at will, huh?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.199
The crimes you committed
are yours alone to bear.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.680
I'll kill you!

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.599
Are you sure you want to kill me?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.479
Li Motong.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.319
You're a rogue

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.680
with blood all over your hands.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.199
You're nothing but a demon!

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:04.840
Your sister's death

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.599
was the unbreakable rule of Wujian.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.479
But if killing me

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.560
can untie the knot in your heart,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.800
then pull the trigger.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.519
Fine.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.720
I'll grant your wish, then.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:52.319
If killing me

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.759
can ease your hatred,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.720
go ahead and kill me, then.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:00.160
I'll spare your life.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.360
That way, you can keep
struggling in this world.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.920
I want you to know
that living is worse than dying.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.319
Between us lies a blood debt.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.199
Let me teach you how to sever all ties

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:22.759

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.160
We can't be friends.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.480
When we meet again,

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.079
we'll be enemies.

I wonder until when

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.279
I'll remain blind.

It was destined
to be a mistake from the start.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.399
From the very beginning, you shouldn't
have had to bear so much.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.800
Li Motong, I hate you.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.839
