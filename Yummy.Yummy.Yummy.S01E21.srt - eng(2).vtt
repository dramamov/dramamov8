00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.020
(Address)

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.160
This street is nice.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.400
The third house.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600
As the old saying goes,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.330
the residential community
is still upscale.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.030
My family,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.830
it's here.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.160
The third house up Anye Alley.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.270
Ms. Du said the previous house
was rented out.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.160
But it's OK.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.550
This one is better, and more spacious.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.590
It even has a yard.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.430
How is it?

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.990
It really is big.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.120
Quite big.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.270
It is indeed beautiful.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.080
Beautiful.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.150
Just...

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.270
Just...

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.310
Where is the big house?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.520
Shen Gongcai!

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.250
- Shen Gongcai!
- Mother.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.710
Where is the big house?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.480
No, no, no.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.360
Come over here.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.680
- Father, you...
- Don't run.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
It's a pre-sale unit,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.520
isn't it?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.300
She made it perfectly clear before.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.430
There really is a house here.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.560
I don't know what's going on.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.640
Are you stupid?

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.300
Why didn't you go see it?

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.310
It was windy those days.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.790
The window is broken and needs repair.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.690
She didn't let me look.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.840
- Oh my goodness.
- You...!

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.430
Without even looking at the house,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.410
you gave her the money?

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.550
She said before

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.900
that she has an old mother

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.080
and a little kid to take care.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.770
Her husband doesn't take care
of anything.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.150
The whole family rely on her alone.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.920
If she couldn't get money that day,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.400
they wouldn't have dinner. It's pitiful.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.520
This is the lowest-level scam

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.190
in the hierarchy
of modern fraud circles.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.300
Even you could fall for it.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.030
Are you stupid?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.650
- How could you hit me?
- Are you stupid?

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.800
I'm telling you,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.290
you really need to learn more from me.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.990
If you could be half as reliable
as I am,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.990
or don't compare with me,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.550
- if you could be,
- Alright, shut up.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.360
You're not as smart as this donkey.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.430
I'm on your side. I didn't...

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.480
Look at it.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.240
Are you trying to make me furious?

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.920
I really shouldn't have counted on you.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.590
You hit me again.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.430
Well,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.990
report to the authorities. Right away.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.080
Get that woman...

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.830
- Ms. Du.
- Yes, Ms. Du.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.800
Get her arrested.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.680
- Don't.
- Tricks from hundreds of years ago,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.030
she dared to use them on us.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.040
- Report it.
- Report it.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.710
Let's go.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.600
Mother. Mother. Mother.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.800
Mother.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.740
Mother. Mother. Mother.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.800
Wait. I'll go get the money back.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.360
- Don't report it.
- Don't...

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.870
Hurry up. Report to the authorities!

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.990
- Well...
- I get the money back and let it be.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.960
Alright?

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.550
Mr. Lin,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.240
someone filed a complaint
against an agent surnamed Du,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.270
claiming that she swindled

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.550
of a large amount of house rent.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.150
Agent fraud?

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.990
First, we must detain the person

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.430
to ensure the money is recovered.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.750
But the person handling the matter said

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.590
the victims

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.640
are the Shen family.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.150
They know about your relationship
with them,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.550
so they came specifically to ask

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.900
if you have any other instruction.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.990
The Shen family?

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.920
I

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.740
have asked

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.090
several agents who handle rentals.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.390
They were unwilling
to reveal Ms. Du's whereabouts.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.190
Fortunately, our family

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.090
is familiar
with the Price Stabilization Office

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.950
and with their help,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.480
we made one of the agents speak

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.240
and found out where this Ms. Du lives.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.600
That's really great.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.550
Yes.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.920
Anyway, she can't run away.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.500
As long as we know where she lives,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.200
we should be able
to find this person soon.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.910
That's right.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.280
Mr. Liu,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.190
luckily we had you

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.320
this time.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.480
They have made no move.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.230
We even thought

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.200
they had dropped the case

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.260
because it was too minor.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.310
If that's really the case,
then we

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.360
can't get our money back.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.200
That's right.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.960
Don't worry.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.760
I think

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.700
we just need to get our money back.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.360
There's no need
to pursue it any further.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.480
This kind of bad person

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.240
must be punished.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.240
Yes, they must be punished.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.320
Yangyang.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.060
(The Du's Residence)

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.520
Mr. Cheng.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.710
Mrs. Shen,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.800
what brings you here?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.080
Don't mention it.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.070
We were swindled out of money
by an agent.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.140
Luckily, Mr. Liu

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.460
helped us find her residence.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.780
This is the place.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.580
So he brought us over here.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.060
Well...

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.500
What's going on here?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.460
Mr. Lin also knew that.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.280
The case has directly gone
to the Prefecture.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.560
- Oh no.
- Right now, this agent

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.820
has now been arrested

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.640
and was sent to the Prefecture
awaiting trial.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.700
Arrested?

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.020
This is good.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.580
(Capital Prefecture)

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.460
Mr. Lin.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.260
Why have the Shen family come?

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.460
Because they also found

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.500
Ms. Du's residence,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.260
so I brought them here.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.660
Mr. Lin.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.260
No need for formalities.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.220
This person

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.660
is the agent who swindled your rent.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.180
I spent a long time

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.380
using connections to find her,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.420
yet you got her effortlessly.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.580
Sorry about that,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.860
Mr. Shen.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.340
Mother.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.040
- She is not.
- She looks so much like her.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.540
They just look alike.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.980
But why does she look exactly

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.180
like my mother?

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.300
I don't know either.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.420
But she really isn't.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.780
I've already confirmed it.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.740
So,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.620
you were deceived

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.580
because she looks extremely

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.660
like my mother.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.020
Mr. Lin,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.140
may I ask you

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.540
to show leniency to Ms. Du?

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.940
She is just a weak woman.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.940
She has no other means
of making a living.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.500
Her whole family depends solely on her.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.420
I believe

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.220
she resorted to this as a last resort

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.780
only because she truly had no choice.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.140
It seems that you have misunderstood.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.460
The estate transactions of her

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.220
are the largest in Yong'an.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.500
She is good at inflating house prices

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.220
and earning high commissions from it.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.740
Nowadays,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.020
she has dozens of servants at home.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.980
She also lives in a large mansion
with three courtyards.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.180
See, what did I tell you?

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.460
I guessed it would be like this.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.980
She is just a fraud.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.580
I guessed it would be like this.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.460
What else have you lied to me about?

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.620
Mr. Shen,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.340
I really didn't mean to.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.060
It's just that you looked

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.220
too easy to deceive that day.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.630
It feels like if I don't lie to you,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.120
I just can't feel at ease in my heart.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.220
Then I had an evil thought.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.880
- I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.
- I...

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.430
You drived up house prices in the past.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.460
Though it was an evil act,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.520
you didn't violate the law.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.660
But this time,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.820
you scammed.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.860
According to the law,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.500
you should be imprisoned.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.510
Great!

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.350
No, no, no.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.240
Mr. Shen,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.060
this is the money you gave me that day.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.340
I return it to you now.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.140
Mr. Shen, please forgive me.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.900
Otherwise I will have to go to prison.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.500
Mr. Shen, I'm begging you.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.310
Mr. Shen, I'm begging you.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.940
Mr. Shen.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.820
Mei,

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.420
have you thought this through?

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.940
Can't you think it over again?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.400
The two of us,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.620
from high school to university,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.720
have always been together.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.580
You know me well.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.900
I am a bit lazy sometimes.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.860
But I will change.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.020
I will definitely change.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.220
I can definitely change that.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.420
Besides, I might not inferior
to that guy in the future.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:57.940
Do you want

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.980
to think it over again?

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.500
Alright,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.740
let's stop here.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.620
You're here.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.060
Wait a moment.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.980
Shaojie,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.820
I really have to go.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.660
Today should be the last time we meet.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.940
In the future,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.380
take good care of Yangyang.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.220
I'm counting on you.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.340
Are you OK?

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.860
I'm fine.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.060
I'm fine.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.100
Nothing wrong with me.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.060
I was thinking about it on my way here.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.180
I'm wondering,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.180
in what way is he better than me.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.420
I have to work hard.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.900
I have to strive for it, right?

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.380
After I saw this,

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.660
I immediately understood.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.100
It's right that you don't want me.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.900
It's human nature, isn't it?

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.060
Well, are you really OK?

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.180
I'm really fine.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.180
I...

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.300
If you don't believe me,

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.260
ask him.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.540
Tell him not to just support you.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.780
Support me as well.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.020
I don't really mind.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.740
This is such a big house.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.690
It won't make much difference
if I'm here, right?

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.360
Come on, you...

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.300
Why are you still the same as before?

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.260
Alright.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.780
I'm leaving.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.100
Let me help you carry your things.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.540
I'll bring it in for you.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.380
Just go.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.220
I'm going.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.620
Let's go.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.900
It's just...

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.180
Mr. Shen...

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.260
I...

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.420
I...

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.180
Forgive her.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.380
We can't possibly

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.940
let someone

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.020
who looks a lot like my mother

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.740
go to prison, right?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.980
Since

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.940
Yangyang said so,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.540
then let it be.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.260
Yes.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.820
Mr. Lin,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.020
let it be.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.820
Father,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.100
I know

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.740
you just can't bear to hurt someone

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.500
who looks exactly like my mother.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.020
I won't be mad at you.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.540
And

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.620
it's also quite normal

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.180
for you to mess things up.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.660
It's OK.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.540
Yangyang,

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.460
do you feel

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.980
that I am embarrassing?

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.180
Every time,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.660
I mess it up.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.660
It makes you lose face,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.500
doesn't it?

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.780
Father,

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.220
I've already gotten used to it.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.260
I am already a big kid.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.860
I have grown up.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.340
I know what kind of person

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.860
my father is.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.580
You just need to be a kind father.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.060
I know

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.980
my father

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.060
definitely won't be some great hero.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.260
So,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.340
you don't have to try so hard anymore.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.540
It's OK if you're not as good as others.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.380
I understand.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.500
I understand.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.260
Father.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.060
Get up.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.460
Get up.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.380
Thank you.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.460
Many thanks, Mr. Shen.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:26.980
Thank you.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:34.060
(Capital Prefecture)

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.980
Mr. Lin,

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.660
about Ms. Du's matter,

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.660
thank you so much.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.860
You're welcome.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.420
Actually, we were planning
to move out quickly.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.900
As a result, we've troubled you again.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.780
It's getting late.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.700
If you can't find a new residence today,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.300
you can still return to Yunshui Manor.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.020
I will send someone to pick Lady Shen.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.500
Mr. Lin, don't worry about us.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.740
Today,

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.100
we just make do at the restaurant.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.060
Yes.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.620
Once we find a new house,

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.060
we will move out right away.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.360
Regarding the matter with Ms. Du,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.500
it was just an accident.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.460
We will find a house as soon as possible

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.340
and move in.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.140
Then I'll have Cheng Hu take you back.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.670
No need to trouble you, Mr. Lin.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.660
My carriage is already waiting here.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.660
Yes.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.340
Mr. Liu will take us back.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.660
Mr. Lin, attend to your business.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.580
We're going.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.940
Many thanks, Mr. Lin.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.020
Thank you.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.220
- Hurry up.
- Thank you.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.980
Mr. Liu, please

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.900
escort them safely back
to the restaurant.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.580
(Guixiang Tavern)
Mr. Lin is this attentive

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.300
to this matter.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.260
It seems he has probably

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.060
fallen for Lady Shen.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.780
In this light,

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.340
it's fortunate that after being rejected
by Lady Shen,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.020
you didn't act rashly again.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.180
Otherwise, if you offended Mr. Lin
because of this,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.300
that would be a loss
outweighing the gain.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.580
Previously, I only knew

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.580
Mr. Lin and the Shen family
are relatives.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.420
I never thought about it deeply.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.820
Thinking back carefully now,

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.160
it seems that Lady Shen also

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.100
has feelings for Mr. Lin.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.900
No wonder.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.380
I never had a chance
from the very beginning.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.250
Since the feelings are not mutual,

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.500
it cannot be forced.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.500
It's just

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.220
that after all these years,

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.820
this is the first time you've met a lady

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.940
you want to marry.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.260
What a pity.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.500
At my age,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.500
establishing a career is more important
than starting a family.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.180
Although we cannot be husband and wife,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.020
we can be friends

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.700
and join forces in and business.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.940
It's also great.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.940
Mr. Lin has boundless prospects.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.980
He will never stop here.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.220
In the future,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.500
if Lady Shen becomes his wife,

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.100
then our Liu family,
as the Shen family's right-hand,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.020
can also benefit from it.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.380
In this way,

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.500
this couldn't be better.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.580
(Shen's Diner)

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.860
Form is emptiness.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.020
Emptiness is form.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.340
Form is emptiness.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.740
Emptiness is form.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.100
Form is emptiness.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.540
Emptiness is form.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.940
Form is emptiness.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.100
Emptiness is form.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.420
Form is emptiness.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.820
Emptiness is form.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.340
Form is emptiness.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.500
Emptiness is form.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.740
I'm a little scared.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.100
It's OK.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.190
Form is emptiness.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.060
Emptiness is form.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.900
Gongcai,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.740
come out.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.460
What are you doing?

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.780
What's going on in there?

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.220
What's wrong with Yangyang saying that?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.220
Is that wrong?

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.340
You are unreliable in your own work.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.380
Others can't point it out?

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.660
We haven't even done anything yet.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.840
- You behave so foolishly.
- Emptiness is form, form is emptiness.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.460
- Come out!
- Emptiness is form.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.540
- Form is emptiness.
- Come out!

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.380
Stop.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.020
If yelling were useful,

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.900
donkeys would rule the world.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.060
Emptiness is form.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.540
Form is emptiness.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.740
Emptiness is form.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.820
Form is emptiness.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.660
Son,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.860
listen to me. Come out.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.140
I know you're feeling upset.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.500
Come out, I will talk with you.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.380
Is it OK?

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.060
Or let your father make you
a few dishes.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.900
Alright?

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.860
Be good, Gongcai.

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.820
Come out.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.660
OK?

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.580
See, everyone is here waiting for you.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.820
Hurry up and come out.

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.740
Emptiness is form.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.540
Form is emptiness.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.300
Shen Shaojie,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.180
you, a grown man, put on this act here.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.460
Who are you trying to show it to?

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.300
If you still don't come out,

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.880
- I'll kick the door open.
- Emptiness is form.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.020
- Form is emptiness
- Three.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.180
- Emptiness is form.
- Two.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.580
Grandma.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.100
- Mother.
- My shoes.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:36.940
Give me the shoes.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.900
Look at him.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.340
Not swayed by persuasion or force.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.060
My brother was never like this before.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.980
Forgive him.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.060
I guess

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.360
he was upset today by that lady

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.460
who looks just like his ex.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.860
He just won't let it go.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.180
Be more understanding toward him.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.300
Yangyang also criticized him.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.380
He felt upset.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.380
Don't you often teach me
not to be impulsive?

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.540
If you really kick this door
and break it,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.470
it will cost money.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.820
We still have to fix it.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.180
Alright, come over here.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.300
Form is emptiness.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620
Emptiness is form.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.100
Form is emptiness.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.540
It seems he has really been affected.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.140
He usually seems pretty carefree.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.140
Why did he suddenly

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.260
become so vulnerable?

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.940
Emptiness is form.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.700
Form is emptiness.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.020
Emptiness is form.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.220
Form is emptiness.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.580
Emptiness is form.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.180
Father,

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.620
I'm sorry.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.140
I shouldn't have said that to you.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.740
If you really want to be a great hero,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.740
I will believe in you too.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.460
Although it's hard to achieve,

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.580
I will still try hard.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.820
Father,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.780
please don't be sad.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.700
Be good, Yangyang.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.940
Don't cry anymore.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.780
Your father will come out.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.100
Father...

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.700
Yangyang,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.700
no matter what,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.540
I will never let you down again.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.140
(Cao Mansion)

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.900
I've made some progress on the matter
you asked me to look into.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.220
The person who stole the slips
from the Princess's residence

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.540
had been reported dead and removed
from the register five years ago.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.420
Then I discovered,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.500
the people reported dead

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.320
include quite a few soldiers
in recent years.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.100
And like that thief,

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.140
we can't find where their graves are.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.020
Maybe these people never actually died.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.580
Could it be

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.740
that someone collected these soldiers

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.780
to fake their deaths?

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.490
In the Ministries of Revenue
and Personnel,

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.680
there are two groups who deregistered

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.500
the household records of these soldiers.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.260
Interestingly,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.380
these two groups of people

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.660
are all students of Zhao Xunzhi.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.300
After talking with Zhao Xunzhi,

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.590
all these people resigned
and returned to their hometowns.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.380
It still ended up involving Zhao Xunzhi.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.900
This matter has a significant impact.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.900
If they raise all these people,

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.940
that would be quite a number
of usable soldiers.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.140
Who needs so many soldiers?

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.860
Who do you think

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.460
it will be?

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.060
(I don't know.)

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.500
I really don't know.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.100
(Prince Zhao)

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.100
Zhao...

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.060
I'll go find His Majesty right away.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.380
I'll risk my life to sue him.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.190
Rest assured.
I will never drag you into this.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.580
Uncle, Uncle.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.620
Calm down.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.700
You promised me

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.940
that you won't act impulsively.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.020
OK.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.220
I don't act impulsively.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.340
Calm down.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.540
Calm down.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.740
I don't act impulsively.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.740
But I can't stand all this filth.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.740
I know you have a forthright nature.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:46.380
When my father was alive,

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.940
he said that when you were classmates,

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.300
whenever you encountered injustice,

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.700
you would always stand up.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.180
Even now, you are still willing
to give all to help me.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.780
I am truly grateful.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.580
It's just that right now
we must not act rashly.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.980
Otherwise, it will alert the enemy.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.220
And it will be harder.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.660
OK.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.660
Back when your father was still around,

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.900
I listened to your father.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.620
Now I will listen to you.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.580
Tell me

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.340
what we should do next.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.900
Zhao Xunzhi

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.100
was able to accomplish these things
quietly.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.740
It shows that he is extremely cautious.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.620
We still need to find a pretext

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.820
to approach him.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.780
(Miss You in Yong'an)

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.420
Go help her.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.580
Lady Jingwen.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:50.700
You are a guest.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.980
How could I let you do this?

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.070
Just a casual act.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.370
I see you're busy.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.460
Sorry to disturbed you.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.740
You don't.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.590
You are the most important guest
in our family.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.660
You can come anytime.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.060
Help deliver this to the kitchen.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.460
Sit with me?

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.700
OK.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.420
Here.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.540
In fact,

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.580
my grandfather is very pleased
with Lin Yan.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.420
Is that what I understand it to mean?

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.420
I don't have a good father
to make arrangements for me.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.580
Only my grandfather worries
about my marriage.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.400
I am already at this age.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.240
It would be improper
not to discuss marriage.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.980
Although Lin Yan is older,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.460
he seems to have good character.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.860
My mother was deeply in love
with my father.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.220
In the end, she was let down
and passed away in grief.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:50.980
I think

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.300
there are no love
between Lin Yan and me.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.900
I will never end up like my mother did.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.540
Are you surprised?

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.020
I do not feel ashamed
for planning for myself.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.140
You should do the same

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.620
and make some plans for yourself.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.460
I am actually the same age as Lin Yan.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.100
I have no plans to get married
in Yong'an.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.060
Are you 25 years old?

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.780
That's not what I mean.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.980
What I mean is,

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.220
I just feel surprised.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.240
You are already this old.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.990
Doesn't your family ever
urge you about it?

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.620
They just want me to be happy.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.620
Aren't they ever afraid of gossip?

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.420
In fact,

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.020
Mr. Lin always wears a stern face,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.860
but he is very kind-hearted.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.420
He will definitely

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.180
treat his wife very well in the future.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.940
He has a lot of unspoken pain
in his heart;

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.740
you must treat him well in the future.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.980
Why does what you said sound so strange?

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.540
It's more like

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.740
an old mother entrusting her child.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.400
You're almost done eating
all the candied hawthorns.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.480
Aren't you afraid of a toothache now?

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.220
I'm still afraid.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.700
But didn't my auntie say

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.140
that one must have courage?

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.180
Is this what your auntie taught you?

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.220
In his current state,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.380
your father can't control you anymore.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.770
He couldn't control her
even when he wasn't like this.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.140
I really think Yangyang
should go to school.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.340
Always keeping her in the restaurant
is not a solution.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.500
That's right.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.780
But can I go to the Hongwen Academy?

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.660
Yangyang,

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.500
listen.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.820
Let's invite a mentor to our home
to teach you.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.340
Actually, it's quite good.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.700
At least it saves the commuting time.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.180
We'll get you

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.220
an excellent mentor

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.060
to teach you first.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.980
Then we'll find an opportunity
to get into the Hongwen Academy.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.780
But I still want to go
to the Hongwen Academy.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.900
If so, I can see the Crown Prince.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.460
She still wants to see the Crown Prince.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.940
I just don't understand.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.280
Back when we were in modern times,

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.790
we didn't have a school district house,

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.890
so it was fine if we couldn't get
into a good school.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.810
Now that we have money.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.520
Why can't we still get
into a good school?

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.740
So ridiculous!

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.300
(Hongwen Academy)

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.740
Take care.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.140
(Ruisi Pavilion)

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.860
(Boundless Ocean of Learning)

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.020
Excuse me.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.140
I'd like to ask

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.420
who said

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.380
that our Yangyang

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.590
could get into Hongwen Academy.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.620
I'm not sure either.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.020
I just pass on the message.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.020
Please take the young lady along.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.940
Alright.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.780
Yangyang, look.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.340
(Ruisi Pavilion)

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.300
Auntie, look.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.900
Their school uniforms look so nice.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.300
That's called a 'Lanshan'.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.180
This is what students wore at that time.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.660
(Ruisi Pavilion)

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.500
Looks nice.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.260
This is the teaching studio
in the academy,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.820
where the mentors live

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.820
and study.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.300
Mentor Zhao is waiting for you.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.610
- Please.
- Alright, let's go.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.500
- OK.
- Let's go.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.350
Thank you.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.240
Let's go.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.460
Mentor Zhao, they have arrived.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.860
Greetings, Mentor Zhao.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.060
Greetings, Mentor Zhao.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.500
You must be Shen Yangyang.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.460
Alright.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.060
Starting from tomorrow,

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.300
you can come here to study.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.300
- That's great.
- That's great.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.700
You all know the rules
of Hongwen Academy, right?

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.500
We know.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.340
Be sure to dress her in men's clothing.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.300
Alright.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.140
Yeah!

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.580
I can finally get
into the Hongwen Academy.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.220
Mentor Zhao,

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.420
I don't know how you chose Yangyang.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.740
I hope you can enlighten me.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.820
Yes.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.660
You actually

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.620
don't even know.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.740
We don't know.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.820
We don't know.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.620
Mentor!

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.380
You...

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.220
Mentor,

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.940
I heard you are
the most influential person

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.800
in the entire Academy.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.580
I request you...

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.180
No, I beg you

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.300
to let our child

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.860
disguise herself as a boy to study here.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.700
As long as you agree,

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.700
I'm willing to work
like a horse or an ox for you.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.540
Alright, alright.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.580
Sir,

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.980
please get up first.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.580
Then we can have a proper talk.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.700
Mentor, if you don't agree,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.180
I won't get up. I'll stay on my knees.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.020
I...

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.500
Please, please, please.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.180
You...

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.700
Why don't you speak?

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.820
Mentor, if you don't speak,

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.100
I'll take it as your agreement.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.500
Then starting from today,

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.200
I will work like a horse or an ox
for you.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.900
I'm yours

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.540
horse or ox.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.200
I just mopped the floor.
Don't rush.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.400
Let me wipe the soles for you.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.620
It's done.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.660
Wait a moment.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.860
The other one.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.660
Please.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.620
(Boundless Ocean of Learning)
Expose your belly to the sun,

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.140
and your back as well.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.740
Get rid of dampness.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.700
I don't believe I can't win you over.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.220
Mentor.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:09.860
Mentor. Mentor.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.780
Don't go, Mentor.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.940
Don't come over!

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.260
- Don't come over.
- Take a look first.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.420
Look how my books are drying.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.020
Good, very good, I'm telling you,

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.740
there are rules for admitting students.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.790
If you keep making trouble,

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:20.810
I'll have to call someone.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.510
Well, Mentor...

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.660
Let me go.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.900
Mentor. Mentor. Mentor.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.700
Don't be impulsive.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.420
You'll gradually
realize my good qualities.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.760
Mentor Zhao, you've finished work.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.860
Wish you a prosperous business.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.720
Mentor Zhao, you've finished work.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.580
Wish you a prosperous business.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.620
Who is it?

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.180
- You... this...
- Well,

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.420
it's me.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.540
What I'm afraid of is you.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.020
Mentor. Mentor.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.060
Mentor.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:47.940
You... you...

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.220
What are you doing?

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.320
Let me carry you on my back.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.380
Someone!

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.420
Put me down.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.300
Someone!

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.260
He's… he's...

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.300
I'll carry you on my back.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.380
Someone!

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.700
Someone!

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.940
Calm down.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.500
Mr. Shen,

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.140
what exactly do you want to do?

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.080
Mentor, you don't know.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.180
I'm warming the bed for you.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.540
This way you'll sleep more warmly.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.980
It's already warm. Come on, sleep.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.060
I'm begging you.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.140
Stop messing around.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.460
OK? Go back.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.940
Go back, will you?

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.820
Mentor, don't beg me.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.180
I'm begging you, truly.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.780
Please let my daughter
enroll and study.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.860
If she doesn't study here,

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.420
I will serve you here for one more day.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.460
My mind is made up.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.460
I'm begging you, Mentor.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.300
I'm begging you.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.180
Please. Please.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.020
Alright.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.260
Forget it.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:07.980
I

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.900
make an exception for you.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.060
Let your daughter come and enroll.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.060
That's great.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.740
Thank you, Mentor, thank you.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.580
No need to thank.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.300
I have only one request.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.020
Got it, disappear immediately.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.180
You, you...

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.300
Mentor, don't be afraid.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.500
I forgot to take my shoes.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.820
Disappear, disappear, disappear.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.300
Yangyang.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.220
Father.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.700
Father.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.300
You're amazing, father.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.540
- Father, you're amazing.
- Look how happy she is.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.180
- Gongcai.
- You actually managed to help me

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.980
get the chance to study
in the Academy.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.940
Father.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.180
- Shaojie, open the door.
- Gongcai.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.390
- Finally, the door is open.
- Father.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.900
Father.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.740
Let's go.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.860
Father.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.560
- Father, where did you go?
- Shaojie.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.660
Shaojie?

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.500
Father?

00:32:58.650 --> 00:32:59.500
Where is he?

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.340
I don't know.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.370
- Father.
- Shaojie.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.380
Where is he?

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.700
You're back.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.020
How is it?

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.560
Can Yangyang go to the Hongwen Academy?

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.300
- Great!
- Deyuan,

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.210
you've been here.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.380
Have you seen my brother?

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.900
I've been in the kitchen.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.790
I didn't notice.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.680
What's wrong?

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.780
Mt father is missing.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.020
My mother doesn't want me anymore.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.860
Now my father has run away too.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.580
No, that won't happen.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.620
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.100
He wouldn't run away.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.860
- He just goes out for a walk.
- Exactly.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.060
He wants to get some fresh air.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.860
- It's fine.
- Don't cry.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.100
This kid...

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:33.900
What is this?

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.820
What's this?

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.580
Looks like it was scratched by a dog.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.780
It's my father's handwriting.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.820
Family members,

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.740
when you see this letter,

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:47.980
I have already embarked

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.500
the journey of starting anew.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.180
At 30, it's the prime age
for exploration.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.820
When I become a great hero,

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.860
I'll return home in glory.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.320
At that time,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.020
you will surely
achieve academic success

00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.780
at the Hongwen Academy.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.140
We will meet at the peak.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.890
I will regularly let you know I'm safe.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:04.980
Do not miss me.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.420
This little brat!

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.980
What is he trying to do?

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.300
What is this?

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.970
How come there's money?

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:16.800
The money in the box
is what I've been saving.

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.220
Leave them to Yangyang

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.180
as pocket money.

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:20.340
- Well...
- Father!

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.140
It's all the money he tricked out of me.

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.330
He hasn't spent a single cent.

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.020
No, I have to go find him.

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.260
- Come back.
- Father...

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.540
Do you know where he went?

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.580
You just go find him.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.860
Besides, he's a grown man now.
How could he get lost?

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.990
He wants to explore outside.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.420
Just let him have a go at it.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.880
There's no way he could be kidnapped.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.300
Him? With that brain of his.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.140
His brain was kicked by a donkey,
you know?

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.540
Father...

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.540
Yangyang, don't cry, don't cry.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.860
Don't cry.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.740
Your father has a really good mind.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.380
Wise yet humble, truly.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.890
He has turned misfortune
into good fortune since he was little.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.560
Nothing happened.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.700
He will definitely come back

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.540
and meet you at the valley.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.660
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.580
Meet you at the peak.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.660
- Really?
- Yes.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.500
Sure.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.420
Sure.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.460
When he comes back,

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.420
he must have built a career for you.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.840
Yangyang,

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.400
you study hard at the Hongwen Academy

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.760
and become an outstanding student.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.380
He will be very happy when he returns.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.540
Meet you at the peak.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.740
Meet you at the peak.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.100
Yangyang, Yangyang, don't cry.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.460
Meet you at the peak.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.580
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.460
Don't cry.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.220
(Yunshui Manor)

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.780
You clearly didn't show up yourself,

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.700
and had Censor Pei invite Zhao Xunzhi.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.940
No matter how I think about it,

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.340
he really has no reason to refuse.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.820
But he still avoids meeting.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.260
Zhao Xunzhi

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.060
must have grown suspicious.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.980
I have obtained Master Xiao's slips.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.500
Prince Zhao must have instructed

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.990
Zhao Xunzhi to be on guard against me.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.960
I still can't rashly
enter the Hongwen Academy.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.340
I need to think of another plan.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.020
Yangyang,

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.780
what are you doing here?

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.140
Do your family know?

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.380
Mr. Lin, I came on my own.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.900
I came here because I want

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.220
to give you this candied hawthorn.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.300
Give it to me?

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.260
Thank you.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.180
Ask me

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.380
why I want to give you it.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.140
Why do you want to give me it?

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.340
Because I'm going to study
in the Hongwen Academy.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.220
This is the opportunity

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.620
that my father fought for me.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.040
I'm giving you this candied hawthorn

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.780
because I'd like to ask you
for some advice

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.660
on how I can

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.500
become an outstanding student.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.100
Yangyang,

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.340
you can't.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.500
Go back and tell your family

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.360
that something goes wrong
with Hongwen Academy.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.860
You must not get involved.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.940
What's wrong?

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.820
Is it because of Mentor Zhao?

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.060
Well, how did you know?

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.420
Mr. Liu Chang,

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.220
when you were just talking outside,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.700
I've already heard what you said.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.900
But this makes it even more exciting.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.740
Mr. Lin,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.900
I want to go there even more now.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.500
I can help you approach Mentor Zhao.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:48.900
Yangyang,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.780
no, absolutely not.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.580
This is not a game for children.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.980
Don't mess around. Let's go.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.580
I'm not a child.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.580
I'm really impressive.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.340
Let's go find your auntie.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.540
(Shen's Diner)

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.980
No, absolutely not.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.180
Yangyang, stop messing around.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.540
This is not child's play.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.940
Auntie, why are you so lacking
in justice?

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.340
Didn't we agree

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.860
that we were going to help Mr. Lin?

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.340
This has nothing to do with justice.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.740
How does it not matter?

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.020
If a great hero is injured,

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.500
would we ignore him?

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.550
If a beggar asks for food at the door,

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.860
would you refuse to feed him?

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.620
Even if Ming wandered to our home,

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.820
it has already become family.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.620
Will you ignore Mr. Lin?

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.420
Mr. Lin, please come with me.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.700
It's OK.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:38.940
It's OK.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.820
You want to reverse the case.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.320
We should give your our full support.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.580
But Yangyang is just a child.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.480
I don't know

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.000
whether you told something to Yangyang.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.020
But this is too dangerous.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.990
- She is not...
- Wait.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.340
You think

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.080
I'm taking advantage of Yangyang?

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.420
I believe you are not
that kind of person.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.100
If you don't have even a bit
of that kind of thought,

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.180
why would you bring her back
and tell us all this?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.260
This is exactly what you think of me?

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:06.860
It's not.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:08.740
I, I...

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.580
Lady Shen,

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.380
Yangyang is not my child.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.600
I can't take harsh words.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.200
I can't make it clear
with gentle words.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.700
So I brought her back to meet you.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.960
Put yourself in my position
and think about it.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.100
If she made such a proposal,

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.080
and I kept it from you,

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.500
then what kind of person am I?

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.140
Sorry.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.300
I didn't think it through enough.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.620
Auntie.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.340
Auntie.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.060
It really wasn't Mr. Lin
who made me do that.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.420
Didn't you teach me

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.620
to be helpful?

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.500
I just want to ask Mr. Lin

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.340
how to be an outstanding student.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.420
Mr. Lin helped me,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.900
and I also need to help him.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.060
Auntie,

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.900
how can you criticize Mr. Lin like that?

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.620
It's just that my concern
has made me anxious.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.060
How could I think
you're that kind of person?

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.460
Even if I am, you are not.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.540
You're not that kind of person either.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.700
Why say that?

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.740
Forget it.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.220
I understand what you mean.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.220
It's fine
as long as you're not mad at me.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.420
I've never been mad at me.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.740
We all don't mind.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.900
Right?

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.900
We're family.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.700
But Mr. Lin,

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.660
if Mentor Zhao really has a problem,

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.700
can we send Yangyang to Hongwen Academy?

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.580
Why can't I go?

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.860
I'm not afraid.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.180
I just want to study there.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.220
The Hongwen Academy is so big.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.220
There are so many people.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.540
Could he really cause such chaos?

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.460
Besides, all those issues of his

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.980
are things of the past.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.260
We just need to be more careful.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.460
Harvard has produced criminals too.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.360
Who would refuse to go to Harvard
just because there are criminals, right?

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.660
Oh my, you even speak of Harvard.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.860
You have a point.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.980
Hongwen Academy is indeed
the best school in Yong'an.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.580
But Zhao Xunzhi

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.980
probably doesn't know
that our two families have old ties.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.860
That's why he agreed
to let Yangyang enroll.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.780
Gongcai's demeanor on the day
he met Mentor Zhao

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.820
really made it hard
to associate him with you.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.860
Then can I help Mr. Lin?

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.420
Yangyang, just focus on your studies.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.860
No need to help me.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.060
Mr. Lin,

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.580
after Yangyang gets into the Academy,

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.660
if she could really help you
approach Mentor Zhao,

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.580
I think this is a good thing.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.460
Right?

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.180
We're family. Nothing to be afraid of.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.380
She must go through hardships.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.860
By then,

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.180
when Yangyang graduated
from the Academy,

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.660
her résumé should definitely
include a note

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.220
that she once helped you
clear your name.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.300
How impressive!

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.180
Exactly.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.860
- This is so cool.
- Is it?

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:42.780
Cool?

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.700
It means impressive.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.140
In my heart,

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.660
Mr. Lin is the coolest.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.340
Yes.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.020
The most awesome.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.540
Sorry.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.260
Sorry.
