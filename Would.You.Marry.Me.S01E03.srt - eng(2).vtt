[Sejung] Hello, Mr. Jang.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.319
Oh, hi, Sejung.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.571
Go on your way. [in English] Good morning.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.782
-Mr. Jang?
-[in Korean] Yes?

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.617
-What?
-A word?

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.744
Okay.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.465
The contract.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.258
[in English] You did a good job.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:55.261
[in Korean] You punk. I knew you'd manage.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.263
I believed in you all along, kid.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:58.348
Okay?

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:01.267

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.727
We can laugh about it.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.896
Do you need anything
from the Business Management Team?

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.481
-Name it.
-Not doing anything

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:07.649

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.364
You and the design company CEO...

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:16.950
Do you know each other?

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.122
How would I know her?
I don't know anyone here.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.958
True. You have zero contacts here.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.419
What kind of deal did you offer
that made her sign it so easily?

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.171
Can you tell me that at least?

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.840
Are you upset I didn't get a bad deal?

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.884

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:40.557
What kind of skills
does my dear cousin have?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.601
I'd like to humbly learn
a few things if I could.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.812
[chuckles softly]

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.732
I won't tell you.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.110
Ask her yourself if you want to know.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.486
I have to head to a meeting.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.531
[stutters] I'm not done talking, punk.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.992
I have a meeting, too, you know.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:05.081
I wish he would trip up
just a bit on the way.

I swear there's more to it.

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.009
You have something urgent to tell me?

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.887
Yes, well...

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.055
It's about J Consulting,

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.433
the company that's helping us
enter the US market.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.812
Yes, is there an issue with them?

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:30.398
Could you take a look at this?

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:39.657
FINANCIAL STATEMENT

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.452
Other than the monthly consulting fee,

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.997
we wire J Consulting all the funds
to build the US factory

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.708
and pay the subcontractors as well.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.212
It looks like J Consulting
is embezzling some of it.

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.630
[♪ gripping, tense music playing]

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.840
I found it odd
and contacted our US counterpart,

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:59.552
and the company itself seems to have
exaggerated their performance.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.138
About this.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.516
Mr. Ko, does anyone other than you
know of this?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.352
No. Right now, it's just me.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.063
You're the first person I'm alerting.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.898
That's very wise of you.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.608
Keep this confidential for now.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.778
I'll look into it as soon as I can.

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:19.113
Yes, sir.

[relator] I have a place
that will be available in a week.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.587
Even if it's a short-term lease,
the deposit is five million won.

[sighs] I don't have five million won.

Oh, you should've called

Are you serious?

You mean you're an officer?

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.973
I wouldn't know if you don't tell me.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.017
I didn't tell until I got in.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.727
It would be embarrassing if I failed.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.938
But why do you need a place
for three months?

00:19:57.196 --> 00:20:00.074
There was a slight mishap that time.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.785
I said I was fine,

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.287
but he insisted on taking me
to see a doctor.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.083
He paid for the treatment
and even took me home.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.627
I was a huge nuisance.

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.964
He's known to be caring and polite.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:18.718
He grumbles,
but does what he can to help out.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.469
I see.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.891
It looks like you kept contacting him.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:28.102
He told me he saw you again,

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:32.481
and that you were a bit strange.

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.024
I was?

00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:37.153
What on earth did he say to her?

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:42.241
He said something about you asking him
to be your husband.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:43.909
What?

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.453
That fool.

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.204
Did he tell her everything?

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.624
We're really close, that's all.

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:54.211
There's nothing we don't know
about each other.

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:55.838
[chuckles nervously]

00:20:58.549 --> 00:21:00.968
Don't mind that at all.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:02.970
It was just a joke.

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:05.556
Don't we all joke like that
every now and then?

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:06.724
[♪ comical sting]

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:11.103
[chuckles]
It's just my neighborhood, then.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:12.271
What?

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:16.400
Did he say anything else?

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.568
Like what?

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.196
Never mind.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:25.284
MYUNGSOONDANG

00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:29.747
Thank you.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.127
He told me to watch myself.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.338
We should sign a non-disclosure agreement.

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.758
What kind of guy
blabbers about everything?

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.555
MYUNGSOONDANG PACKAGING DESIGN PROPOSAL

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.059
As you can see,

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:53.646
Myungsoondang's packaging
is usually simple and generic.

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:56.315
So, on days other
than major national holidays,

00:21:56.398 --> 00:22:00.194
they seem a bit old-fashioned
for exams, Christmas, or birthdays.

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.281
The new packaging

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.909
caters to various special occasions
other than just national holidays

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:09.954
with a more youthful, cute design.

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:11.121
I like it.

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.624
-That one over there is cute.
-They're pretty.

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:15.084
It would be a Stargram hit.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.046
[remote beeps]

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:20.256
Thank you.

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:22.466
[all applauding]

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:24.468
I like it.

00:22:25.803 --> 00:22:27.721
Wouldn't everyone want one?

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:29.098
What do you think?

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:30.182
It looks nice.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.018
-[Sejung] I really like the colors.
-[whispers] Good job.

00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:34.478
[Wonseok] This looks pretty cute.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:37.731
-Thank you.
-Well done.

00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:42.152
Mr. Kim.

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:47.116
You young people
have such great ideas and taste.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.243
Thank you. I'll do my best.

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:50.327
[chuckles softly]

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.038
-Oh, Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:54.540
Are you free this evening?

00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:57.293
Well, yes.

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:59.378

00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:01.922
Okay, everyone.

00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:05.926
To the collaboration
of Myungsoondang and Merry Design Studio.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.720

[exclaims]

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:13.934
Look at the marbling on the meat.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.228
Prime beef surely is better.

00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:20.107
Please enjoy, Mr. Kim.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.942
Yes, thank you.

00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:25.237
-You should eat, too, Sejung.
-I will. By the way...

00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:28.282
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-I don't.

00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:30.326
What about an ideal type?

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:32.912
[Kim Wooju] Not really.

00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:34.330
Are you against marriage?

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:39.627
No, I'm not against marriage,
but I don't think it's a must, either.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.836
[Wonseok] Hey.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.296
You and I are on the same page.

00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:45.257
I guess handsome guys think alike.

00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:49.887
Wonseok, you're not in his league.

00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:52.640
You're not single by choice.

00:23:52.723 --> 00:23:55.351
-You applied to be on I Am Single.
-[scoffs]

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:56.727

00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:00.606
You'll talk about anything.

When will you be on the show?

00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:03.317
I heard the competition's fierce.

00:24:06.904 --> 00:24:08.906
Wait, they didn't call for an interview?

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:13.035
-[bangs table]
-See? What did I tell you?

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:16.830
If you want to get married,
you must go all in and buy an apartment.

00:24:16.914 --> 00:24:19.208
You still rent a place,
which is worse than losing hair.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.293
I told you to buy
the old apartment in Ojun-dong.

00:24:21.377 --> 00:24:23.462
It would've been great
if you'd bought it then.

00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:24.964
The value increased by 50 million won.

00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.173
[sighs]

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.634
Okay.

Let's drink.

00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:30.928
Sure.

00:24:32.763 --> 00:24:35.265
You can't afford a home
with a normal salary these days.

00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:37.393
I've given up in this lifetime.

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.311
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:41.939
Why don't you enter
a department store raffle?

00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:43.649
They give away five-million-dollar places.

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.651
[Wonseok] Five million dollars?
That's a thing?

00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:46.986
[Ms. Oh] You didn't know?

Hang on. Is it over?

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.490
It was Beauté Department Store.

Why should someone from another company

I couldn't say no.

Mr. Baek was over, and he suspected us.

Why did you try to kill the mosquito?

00:57:03.795 --> 00:57:05.088
So what if you get bitten?

00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:06.256
Would it kill you?
