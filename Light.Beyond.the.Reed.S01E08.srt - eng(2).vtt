00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.260
Don't worry.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.020
It won't affect the group's reputation.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.910
Of course.

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:01.066
Let's play golf next time.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.220
I'll call you again.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.740
Don't worry about it.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.890
Well, that hurt my ear.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.220
How did it go?

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.500
Hurry and tell me about it.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.570
Shuhui,

00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:17.577
you have to be prepared mentally.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.570
Judging from Ye Sibei's behavior,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.850
she's going to pursue the matter.

00:02:20.888 --> 00:02:22.220
Once he's been convicted of rape,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.555
he will receive severe punishment.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.888
No one will be able to save him.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.500
Jiancheng was seduced by her.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.570
Can't you tell that Ye Sibei
isn't doing this for the money?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.890
I don't care why she's doing so.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.450
I trust that Jiancheng

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.890
wouldn't do such a thing.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.660
Frankly speaking,
this is a case of mutual consent.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.970
The crime of rape

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.380
doesn't exist.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.510
I was afraid that you would
dwell on this matter.

00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:47.400
But look at you.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.890
You're doing pretty well.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.100
Right now,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.890
we have to hire the best lawyer
we can find in Nancheng.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.730
Ye Sibei doesn't know
what's good for her.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.610
I'll show her who's the boss here.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.540
Please calm down.

00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:02.711
You can't just drag
everyone down with you

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:04.610
because of your personal issues.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.450
Brother.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.540
What do you mean by that?

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:09.555
You can't just leave me in the lurch.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.940
Jiancheng has watched over
Fuqiang on your behalf for many years.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.340
He did everything for you.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220
You should at least
appreciate his efforts.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.711
You can't just leave him in the lurch.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.100
Based on all the information
I've received,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.711
that's not the only deed he has done.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.850
Fine.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.730
I understand now.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.540
You're trying to leave him
in the lurch here.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.220
Anyway,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.730
if Jiancheng wins the lawsuit,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.010
you'll fire Ye Sibei.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.820
If Ye Sibei wins the lawsuit,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.170
you'll fire Jiancheng.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.100
By then, you'll make an announcement.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.466
An executive of the company
raped one of your employees.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.260
It may affect the company's reputation,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.500
but it has nothing
to do with you at all, am I right?

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.100
You're going overboard here.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.100
Did I say I'd abandon him?

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.010
Aren't I your elder brother?

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.610
Why do you think I'm here
if I didn't intend to intervene?

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.940
If so, you should think of a way

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.410
to save him.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.610
Your niece is asking for
her father every day, you know?

00:03:58.088 --> 00:03:59.820
How could you bear to see her like this?

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.500
I'm doing something about it, aren't I?

00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:10.620
- You're here.
- Mr. Zhao.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.900
Welcome.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.100
- Please come inside.
- Okay.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.660
Please come inside.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.688
This is my younger sister.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.930
You wanted to hire a lawyer, right?

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.490
I got you the best lawyer in Nancheng.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.220
This is Meng Xin.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.910
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:26.370
Mr. Meng. Nice to meet you.
It must've been a long trip.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.290
Please have a seat.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.866
- It's my duty.
- Please have a seat.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.180
Mr. Meng,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.580
how's the case?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.810
Your husband had confessed to the police

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.370
that he had sex with
the person involved.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.810
However, he didn't admit
that he raped her.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.340
He explained that he was seduced
by the person involved.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.780
I believe Jiancheng's words.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.220
Mr. Meng,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.980
please use your best team

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.490
and your best men.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.100
There's no need
to worry about the fees.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.220
I just want to see

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.460
how long Ye Sibei can stay arrogant.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.930
You guys had met
the person involved in private.

00:05:04.244 --> 00:05:06.488
And, you guys attempted to do
a monetary deal with her.

00:05:06.488 --> 00:05:08.000
It's hugely detrimental to your case.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.140
That was my own idea.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.050
It has nothing to do
with Jiancheng at all.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.050
He won't be sent to jail
because of this, right?

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.100
Ms. Zhao, I understand your feelings.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.460
But I hope you can remember this.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.100
From now on,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.220
I'm your only connection
to the outside world.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.770
Understood.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.930
So, Mr. Meng,

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.220
how confident are you
in winning this lawsuit?

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.050
You see, evidence is vital in the court.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.220
I came here today to tell you this.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.610
Mr. Fan has now been placed

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.490
under extended detention.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.780
During this period,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.050
you guys must remain composed.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.780
Do not do anything radical.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.490
I'll do whatever I can.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.220
I understand.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.620
I understand.

Okay, Mr. Zhao.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.570
Don't worry about it.

Are you going to defend a rapist?

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.977
Nianwen, you should sit down first.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.820
Why?

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.930
You knew
that Fan Jiancheng was a rapist.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.444
He has ruined my sister's life!
Why are you trying to help him?

Nianwen,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.460
I can understand your feelings.

But Zhao Ming, the big boss of Fuqiang,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.730
is an old client of ours.

I have to find out the truth
behind the case.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.610
Are you saying that my sister is lying?

00:07:04.244 --> 00:07:05.711
Is that what you're trying to say?

00:07:06.266 --> 00:07:08.170
Do you think
a professional attorney like you

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.370
should say something like that?

00:07:09.377 --> 00:07:11.100
You already jumped
to your own conclusion

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.170
before the judge gave his verdict.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.580
Stop trying to lecture me here!

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.533
You're doing this
because they paid you, right?

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.930
Where's your conscience?

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.580
Fan Jiancheng is inhumane!

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.730
He's a beast!

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.930
Master, you've handled
so many cases before.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.100
You've helped
so many victims seek justice.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.170
Why are you helping him out?

Nianwen.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.730
Calm down and think about it.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.580
Even if I don't take on this case,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.050
someone else will take it on.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.100
Why must it be you, then?

You're my mentor, you know?

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.370
I even told Sibei

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.529
that you were the best attorney
in all of Nancheng.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.933
I said you had a sense of justice.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.850
I said that you could
help her seek justice.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.370
Master, I don't understand at all.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.220
Why are you trying
to defend Fan Jiancheng?

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.250
Have you ever considered
my circumstances?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.490
Nianwen!

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.050
As an attorney,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.170

from the law's perspective.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.610
We have to view issues objectively!

I'll give you a few days off.
Take a break, okay?

No need for that.

00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:22.100
Mr. Meng, if you insist on
helping the tyrant out,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.340
I won't remain in a law firm like this.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.250
Can you please calm down?

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.400
I'm very calm right now.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.730
Gui and the gang?

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.940
It's been so long since we met.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.933
Why don't you join us?

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.980
Sure. Wait for me.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.066
I'll go and get changed.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.060
You look pretty busy.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.300
Ye Sibei.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.020
You're back.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.100
Don't be nervous.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.220
I came here to talk to you.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.580
I've already
made myself clear last time.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.580
I can't just withdraw the case at will
after it's filed.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.100
No need to waste your time on me.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.730
Regarding the previous incident,

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.250
Tao Jie and I were too agitated.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.850
Give me a chance.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.250
Let's have a good chat.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.060
Give me a chance

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.340
to apologize to you, okay?

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:19.570
Nan, over here.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.460
Why are we heading
to another place today?

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.300
Not San's place?

00:10:22.577 --> 00:10:23.850
We can't head there all the time.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.980
We're tired of the food there.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.770
I found a new place.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.610
You should try it.

00:10:27.066 --> 00:10:28.130
Have you struck it rich?

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.130
Look at what you're saying.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.622
I just wanted to treat
you to a meal.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:31.850
Bro, this is the place.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.850
Nan, come here.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.010
Nan, over here.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.100
Nan, hurry and have a seat.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.860
Nan.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.820
Gui.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.340
- Nan, have a seat.
- Gui.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.180
Here.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.460
Nan, here.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.420
Today's a great day.
Everyone's here. Let's have a drink.

00:10:46.422 --> 00:10:47.980
I drove here and you know that.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.340
We have replacement drivers.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.180
Don't do this.

00:10:50.222 --> 00:10:51.420
I need to work this afternoon.

00:10:51.422 --> 00:10:52.490
I'll be fine with some tea.

00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:54.490
It's rare for everyone
to gather here today.

00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:56.044
Is there an important announcement?

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.340
Nan,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.340
you see,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.530
we grew up together.

00:11:00.822 --> 00:11:02.220
You're the only child of the family.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.300
Your grandfather instructed us
before his passing.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.810
He said,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.850
although we aren't biological siblings,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.100
we have to help each other out
like true siblings, right?

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.650
I remember what Grandpa said.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.300
Nan,

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.180
if that's the case,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.610
all of us are a family.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.220
If so, I should be considered
your eldest brother.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.100
Gui, you're right.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.180
All of us have heard about

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.940
what happened to Sibei.

00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:29.890
Tell us if
you're facing any difficulties.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.650
We'll support you.

00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:38.850
I've investigated your background.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.940
You're 28.

00:11:42.377 --> 00:11:43.955
You're an undergraduate student.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.490
Your husband owns a car workshop.

00:11:47.066 --> 00:11:49.222
Your younger brother
just graduated from college.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.330
Your parents

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.730
own a breakfast shop.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.490
What are you trying to say?

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.130
I got married at 25.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.610
I couldn't bear a child

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.460
due to biological reasons.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.370
I've struggled all the way to 28.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.300
After that, I went for IVF,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.355
and I gave birth to Wenwen.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:05.570
Wenwen

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.300
is the sole reason I live.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.420
I even brought a picture of her with me.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:14.610
Let me show it to you.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.330
Take a look.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:17.730
Here.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.850
This is what she looked like
when Jiancheng helped her to walk.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.940
This is her when she was five.

00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:24.610
This is her when she was six. Look.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.420
Do you know

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.130
what'll happen to our family

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.850
if Jiancheng is imprisoned?

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.850
Wenwen likes to play the piano.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.650
She has already won several top awards.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.530
Her teacher said
she had a lot of potential.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.940
If she can persevere,

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.530
she'll definitely have
a bright future ahead of her.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.130
However...

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.420
If she's known as
the daughter of a rapist,

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.530
her life will be ruined.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.450
Other people

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.850
would mock her

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:03.850
and humiliate her.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.010
When she grows up,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.850
her political background check

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.130
will show that her father
is a convicted rapist.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.850
Actually, there are many ways

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.060
to resolve this issue.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.300
You can tell me your conditions.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.100
So,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.180
you believe my words, right?

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.460
Or are you telling me

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.260
that this isn't your first time
cleaning up his mess?

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.450
That's not it.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.770
I don't understand at all.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.890
This is the fault of a man.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.890
How did it end up becoming our issue?

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.530
It's because I'm a mother!

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.340
But you're a human foremost.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.300
And I,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.530
I'm a human as well.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.890
Your daughter plays the piano.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.180
She has won several awards.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.650
And, she has a delicate upbringing.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:20.980
What about me?

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.220
I grew up in the slums.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.370
Therefore, it doesn't matter
even if my life is ruined, right?

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.460
But what gives?

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.770
Why must I face the music just so

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.866
you and your family
could live happily ever after?

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.770
It's not like
we're getting off scot-free.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.220
I said it already.
You can tell us your conditions.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.730
But the conditions I demand

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.770
are conditions
that you guys cannot fulfill.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.220
If all of the conditions

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.010
are within your range of acceptance,

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.100
that criminal will never repent.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.890
But the child is innocent!

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.180
Why must you

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.010
do something that'll hurt the innocent?

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.220
Why did you call the cops?

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.650
You should tell that to Fan Jiancheng.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.530
It's getting late.

00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:11.180
I'll make a move first.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.220
Ye Sibei.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.010
I beg you.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.890
Please let my family off.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.220
Please let my child off.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.250
Please let Wenwen off.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.530
We've already paid the price.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.010
I beg you.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.220
I beg you.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.340
What if I'm your daughter, then?

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.060
Would you beg me to let him off?

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.060
You won't do that.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.460
And, this is my only answer.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.010
I won't let him off.

00:15:56.066 --> 00:15:58.088
And, I cannot forgive him
for what he did.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.820
Sibei,

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.690
where are you?

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.370
I'm almost home.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.370
Okay.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.490
I'll reach home soon.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.090
Sibei.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:14.980
You're back.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:38.610
What's wrong?

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.260
Sibei.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.180
Did you lead a tough life before this?

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.050
Perhaps.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.860
But I think life has eased up for me

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.090
after you asked me that.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.770
From now on, I shall share

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.330
your burdens with you.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:35.780
♪Just let the dark night remember♪

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:43.450
♪How should I walk toward tomorrow?♪

Let's go home.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:52.410
♪Helpless against the rumors and teases♪

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.500
Let's go home.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:09.440
♪Listen to the deep sea♪

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:17.630
♪Listen to the soundless breathing♪

♪Screaming until my voice is cracked♪

♪As loneliness swallows me whole♪

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.090
Let's cook this one next.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.180
Why did you treat me to BBQ today?

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.244
Did you get your bonus?

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.770
What's wrong?

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:12.890
I...

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.010
I've already resigned.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.860
But why?

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.490
It's because my mentor

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.860
has become Fan Jiancheng's attorney.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.250
But don't worry.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.330
I'll continue to look for new jobs.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.860
I just hope that you can hide this fact

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.420
from my parents for now.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.090
So what if you've resigned?

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.770
Sibei helped us out a lot in the past.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.050
Now,

After this toast,

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.330
we have to tighten our belts.

It's fine. It's my duty.

Nan, you didn't come
to the workshop yesterday.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.190

came for an investigation.

It's because we did a good job usually.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.050
can stand this

I'll cook it and deliver it to you
if you're busy.

It's fine. There's no need for that.

I'll have the fish at home.

Sibei, what's wrong?

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.080
I'm fine.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.210
I just slipped and fell.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.010

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.410

Why don't we move somewhere else?

00:28:13.288 --> 00:28:14.490
Let's move to another house.

00:28:14.933 --> 00:28:16.490
We can move to the neighboring town.

00:28:16.955 --> 00:28:18.600
I've already viewed the houses there.

00:28:18.844 --> 00:28:20.250
It's not that far from our house.

00:28:20.377 --> 00:28:22.250
We can reach there
after an hour of driving.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.355
If so, it'll take you two hours
to travel to and back from work.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:27.840
I love to drive.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.360
But you see, it's difficult
to rent out our house.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.730
You don't need to worry about the money.

00:28:44.666 --> 00:28:46.280
I don't think we should move out.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.250
I like staying here.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.360
I'm already used to it.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.400

No thanks. We won't bother you.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.080
We'll just have a casual chat out here.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.360
We received a police report.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.730
Ye Sibei and her family

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.320
were harassed recently.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.120
We came here
to inquire about the situation.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.010
Did she say that I was the culprit?

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.280
Does she have any evidence?

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.210
She didn't state it explicitly.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:07.800
However, I think we have the obligation

00:30:07.888 --> 00:30:08.930
to give you a reminder.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.490
Officer, you don't need to remind me.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.770
My attorney told me that long ago.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:13.530
I see.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:14.370
Ms. Zhao.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.640
Anyway,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.600
at this moment,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.100
I'm sure no one wants
any additional trouble.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.870
We have a simple motive
for coming today.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.730
We came here to inquire about

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.800
the best friends your husband has.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.360
Captain Zhang.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.490
I've been raising my child at home

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.770
ever since I got married.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.250
I didn't even visit his company much.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.360
How would I know

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.170
who his friends are?

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.800
How could that be?

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.450
Did no one come to find your husband
after the incident?

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.560
Your elder brother
and Fan Jiancheng

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.170
have a superior-subordinate
relationship, right?

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.410
Enough. What about this?

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:55.250
Ms. Zhao.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:56.560
After this,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.880
if you have the chance,
try to know more about...

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.360
Forget about his friends.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.010
Anyway, if you meet anyone he knows,

00:31:07.066 --> 00:31:09.250
please tell them not to
threaten the party involved again,

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.888
so that she'll
back down from the case.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.770
If they threaten her again,

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.490
Fan Jiancheng won't be the only one
we arrest next time.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.450
We did nothing...

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.560
Mom!

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.410
Wenwen, don't run.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.250
What are you doing?

00:31:19.288 --> 00:31:20.360
What are you doing out here?

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.120
Don't take Mom away.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.640
You guys have already taken Dad from us.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.280
I need to protect Mom.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.770
Wenwen, don't worry.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.640
I'm not going anywhere.

00:31:29.688 --> 00:31:31.044
No one is going to take me away.

00:31:31.111 --> 00:31:32.120
Your daughter is adorable.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.490
What a beautiful girl.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.120
Alright, then. We'll stop bothering you.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.970
We'll head back first.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.600
Alright. Take care.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.490
Goodbye.

00:31:39.133 --> 00:31:40.610
- Goodbye.
- Sorry for the bother.

00:31:54.822 --> 00:31:56.730
It's late now. Who said
you could come outside?

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:57.730
It's cold out here.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.800
Hurry and go to bed.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.530
Let's go.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.840
Let's go to bed.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.210
(Did you ask your husband
how business is lately?)

00:32:34.444 --> 00:32:35.560
Can't fall asleep, huh?

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.490
I intend to take the CPA exam next year.

00:32:44.777 --> 00:32:46.111
Do your best for the preparations.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.120
I'll do my best

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.170
and make preparations.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.360
Once I pass the exam,

00:32:54.088 --> 00:32:55.880
we can move to
the provincial city together.

00:32:55.977 --> 00:32:57.800
We can own a new workshop together.

00:33:00.533 --> 00:33:02.377
Therefore, for this year...

00:33:05.222 --> 00:33:06.450
You don't need to worry.

00:33:07.066 --> 00:33:08.200
I'm here for you.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.450
(Fuqiang Real Estate)

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.250
Mr. Zhao, were you looking for me?

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:30.570
Have a seat.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:36.850
Chuchu.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.730
I summoned you

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.320
because I have something to tell you.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.010
I heard from Tao Jie that it's been

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.730
some time
since you joined the company.

00:33:45.777 --> 00:33:47.511
Our company has treated you well, right?

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.377
You provide full social insurance
and housing fund,

00:33:50.377 --> 00:33:52.280
pay salaries on time,
and offer bonuses and benefits.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.490
Everyone knows that.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.490
Mr. Zhao,
please get straight to the point.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.230
Chuchu, you know this too.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.410
The company is facing a difficult time.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.410
The gossip out there

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.230
is affecting our company negatively.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.160
The major business deals
that you guys were in charge of...

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.640
They might be jeopardized
because of this incident.

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.490
The bonus is worth tens of thousands,
you know?

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:16.930
It's such a shame.

00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:19.490
Mr. Zhao, Ms. Tao,

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:21.930
if the business deals are off,
we can clinch new deals.

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:24.120
You see, the Sales Department
is full of experts.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.440
Indeed.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.240
But you see,
if the company's reputation is affected,

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.200
it's pointless, no matter

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.560
how good the Sales Department is.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:31.940
Chuchu,

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.850
just now, I was telling Mr. Zhao

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.490
that you're both beautiful

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:37.770
and very capable.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.022
The company regards you highly.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:42.130
Mr. Zhao said

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:43.490
that the company will

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:45.370
reward you handsomely

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.490
if you resolve the crisis for us.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:48.530
Am I right, Mr. Zhao?

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:53.450
The Sales Department lacks a supervisor.

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:54.622
Do you want to give it a try?

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.570
Mr. Zhao, Ms. Tao...

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.450
How can I resolve this crisis?

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.410
Chuchu, you see,
regarding this incident,

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.170
don't you think the cause is Ye Sibei?

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.450
Why would we be in deep trouble

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.377
if she didn't call the cops
in the first place?

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:11.850
What about this?

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.770
Try to persuade her to drop the charges.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:14.850
If she drops the charges,

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:15.890
Mr. Zhao said

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.410
that the company would compensate her.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.450
Okay?

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.666
I can't do anything about that.

00:35:20.133 --> 00:35:21.810
Nianwen can't
do anything about it either.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.730
There's no way we'll do it.

00:35:27.777 --> 00:35:29.090
The company is in trouble here.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.170
Are you not willing
to help us out at all?

00:35:34.955 --> 00:35:36.650
Don't you wish to keep your job?

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.050
I guess I don't.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.170
Chuchu!

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.450
It's difficult to find a job nowadays.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.450
You see, Mr. Zhao

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.770
is giving you
a rare promotion chance here.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.022
This is an easy task for you.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.410
Besides,

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.770
you and Nianwen
still have a loan to repay.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.533
You need all the money
you can get, right?

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:03.850
Chuchu!

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.170
Chuchu, let's talk it over. Come here.

00:36:08.511 --> 00:36:10.066
Ms. Tao, you're a woman as well.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.090
Today, you're trying
to be their mediator.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.330
But what if the same thing
happens to you one day?

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.410
When that happens, I hope
that you can repeat the same thing

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.690
you said to me to yourself.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.210
Chuchu, what nonsense
are you talking about?

00:36:26.377 --> 00:36:28.090
What?
You can't withstand such an insult?

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.530
To hell with this stupid company!

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.290
Chuchu!

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:35.930
Get out of my way.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.570
You'd better not come back after this!

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.370
You think I want to stay here?

00:36:43.577 --> 00:36:45.311
