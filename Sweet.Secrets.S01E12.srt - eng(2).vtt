(Brother's Game)

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.560
I told you

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.159
not to trust humans.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.479
Especially that woman.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.280
But you refused to listen.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.799
Look where it's gotten you now.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:48.719
You've seen it yourself.

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.600
She swore she'd always love you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.719
not long ago.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.679
And now she wants
to kill you, Li Motong.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.719
If you came just to mock me,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.799
get out.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.799
The gun is yours.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.319
And it's pointed at you now.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.719
Come to your senses,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.000
Li Motong.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.359
Get out!

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.200
You're as stubborn as ever.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.200
Would you rather die

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.560
for a woman who tried to kill you

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.920
instead of taking back the Mei pearl?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.519
I'll protect her with my life.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.000
I won't let her be harmed.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.280
Fine.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.680
Do you think I'll spare you

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.879
just because
you refuse to take the pearl?

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.560
Just wait and see.

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.159
The Mei pearl belongs to Wujian.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.159
So why do you still hesitate

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.360
to reclaim it?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.400
I accept whatever fate
my love for her brings.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.520
But why must you all

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.360
keep standing in my way?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.879
Because the burden you carry

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.080
is not yours alone.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.719
It concerns the fate of Wujian.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.000
Wujian cannot do without you.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.319
The choice is cruel.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.800
Yet

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.560
I must sacrifice that human.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.879
To me,

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.879
she's not just anyone.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.080
She means more than my life.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.159
I can't sacrifice her

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.199
just to save my own skin.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.919
But she knows the truth now.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.199
She'll never forgive you

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.719
nor love you again.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.120
No matter what,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.199
it's time you let her go.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.919
I'm warning you.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.400
Don't stand in my way.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.120
And leave her alone.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.000
(Sister.)

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.520
(It's over between him and me.)

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.960
(What's left between us)

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.439
(is only hatred.)

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.520
They've been lenient with you,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.120
but I'm not.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.400
Killing you would be
as easy as crushing an ant.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.039
Go ahead and kill me, then.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.240
Why? Are you afraid
of thunder punishment?

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.159
I've changed my mind.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.520
I won't take your life.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.159
Instead, I'll make you suffer.

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:31.560
This is fun!

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.839
How exciting.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.319
You have no shame.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.160
Just kill me already!

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.720
That'd be no fun.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.519
What are you doing here?

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.959
I heard you caught
the top star of the Paramount.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.959
Of course I came to join the fun.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.319
Our lofty superstar, Lu Huayan.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.519
How pathetic you look now.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:55.720
You've actually colluded with them

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.720
and become Wujian's lapdog!

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.160
Well, something's missing.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.399
We need an audience here.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.800
I'll give Li Motong a call.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.319
Who is this?

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.639
Mr. Li, can you tell who this is?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.319
Your woman's with me.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:24.959
Aren't you curious what she's doing?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.600
Yan.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.040
What are you doing to her?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.800
Today's circus is quite the spectacle.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.560
What have you done to Yan?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.000
Give her the phone.

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:38.639
I said, give her the phone!

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.040
Why don't you come to her rescue?

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560
Oh, right.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.560
Your Wujian force is fading.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.199
And after that thunder strike retribution,

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.000
you're barely alive.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.959
You're no match for me now.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.319
Let her go.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.240
Do you hear me?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.319
So,

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.560
should I kill her?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.920
How fun.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.959
It's truly fun.

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:04.040
Wait for me, Huayan.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.160
I'll come to your rescue now.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920
I'd rather die

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.800
than receiving your favor!

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.319
Did you hear that?

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:12.120
Stop deluding yourself.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.600
I'll make sure she suffers for you.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.439
How delightful! This is exciting!

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.959
This is fun!

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:25.639
Yan...

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:27.079
Yan!

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.720
Even his torture
is better than seeing you again!

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.199
Did you hear that?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.079
You good-for-nothing.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.319
Mr. Jing.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.480
Are you sure this will make him
give up on Lu Huayan?

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.079
I have other ways.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.920
If breaking her body doesn't work,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.120
I'll break her heart.

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:12.759
Miss Lu.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.000
My brother has been reckless.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.160
Besides killing your sister,
he wants you for himself.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.199
Why not come with me instead?

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:22.800
Sure, Mr. Jing.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.560
The world's already gone mad.

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.399
A little more madness

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.759
doesn't make any difference.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:43.959
Perfect.

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:51.199
(Li Motong.)

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:53.560
(I'll make you pay dearly.)

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.759
Extra! Extra!

Mr. Li is here.

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.399
Mr. Li.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.980
Are you sure you're not mistaking me
for someone else?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.240
Yan...

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:43.360
Miss Lu.

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:47.399
Didn't you say you wanted
to get rid of Li Motong?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.919
Indeed.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.159
I'm in a good mood today.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.240
Mr. Jing.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:57.159
Shall we dance together?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.120
Lan.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.799
What's going on?

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.720
Stop it.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:12.639
Come on.

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:13.720
Don't look.

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:14.960
Get back to work.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:16.200
Huayan.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.799
What are you doing?

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:20.320
I'm dancing with the man I like.

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:22.200
Isn't that a normal thing to do?

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:24.200
What does that have to do with you?

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.120
Even if you hate me,

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.639
you shouldn't stoop so low

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:28.519
and dance with a wolf.

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:32.200
Mr. Jing.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.840
This way, please.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.519
Don't look.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.639
Go attend to that guest.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.519
Yes.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.519
Li Motong.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.240
Miss Lu will soon become my wife.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.039
You'd better leave now.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.559
Don't spoil Miss Lu's good mood.

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:56.559
Jing Haisi.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.320
Don't think I have no idea

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.759
what you're up to.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.840
Li Motong.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.240
Mr. Jing is my future husband.

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:07.120
Mr. Jing.

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:09.159
Li Motong has been rude to you.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.799
I apologize to you on his behalf.

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.240
You apologize for him?

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.399
How will you make it up to me?

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:20.080
How about

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.960
we have a few more dances?

00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:23.799
That should make up for it.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.399
Li Motong.

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:33.639
Take a good look.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.960
I can have

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:37.200
your woman too.

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:40.919
You've gone too far!

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.440
Wait for me in the car.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.519
Yan.

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.159
Why are you acting this way?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.240
Mr. Li.

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:55.159
Have you forgotten?

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:57.960
I've always been a dancer
here at the Paramount.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.600
Isn't it normal

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:02.159
for me to dance with men?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240
Be it him

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.440
or you,

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:08.559
it's just the same.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.639
What is it you really want?

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:16.440
Did you really think I ever loved you?

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.360
I never loved you.
